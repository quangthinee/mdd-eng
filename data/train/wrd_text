HQTV_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
HQTV_arctic_b0189 that is what distinguishes all of us from the lower animals
HQTV_arctic_a0475 his outstretched arm dropped to his side and he paused
HQTV_arctic_b0386 my idea was that he would have more influence over the natives
HQTV_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
HQTV_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
HQTV_arctic_b0288 we would not spend another such night
HQTV_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
HQTV_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
HQTV_arctic_a0515 but here amongst ourselves let us speak out
HQTV_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
HQTV_arctic_b0465 but such divergence of opinion would constitute no menace to society
HQTV_arctic_b0251 they must have been swept away by the chaotic currents
HQTV_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
HQTV_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
HQTV_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
HQTV_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
HQTV_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
HQTV_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
HQTV_arctic_b0527 the very idea of it was preposterous
HQTV_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
HQTV_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened
HQTV_arctic_b0481 the task we set ourselves was threefold
HQTV_arctic_a0075 there has been a change she interrupted him
HQTV_arctic_a0090 the singing voice approached rapidly
HQTV_arctic_a0029 their forces were already moving into the north country
HQTV_arctic_a0027 to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
HQTV_arctic_a0018 there was a change now
HQTV_arctic_a0378 that's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged
HQTV_arctic_a0134 he obeyed the pressure of her hand
HQTV_arctic_a0434 a half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds
HQTV_arctic_a0112 he was wounded in the arm
HQTV_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
HQTV_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
HQTV_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
HQTV_arctic_b0075 in that case he could not miss them if he used caution
HQTV_arctic_b0074 yet behind them there was another and more powerful motive
HQTV_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
HQTV_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
HQTV_arctic_b0323 crickets began to chirp and more geese and ducks flew overhead
HQTV_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
HQTV_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
HQTV_arctic_b0358 the temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip
HQTV_arctic_b0140 they edged nearer and stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world
HQTV_arctic_b0106 for a full minute the two men stared into each other's face
HQTV_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
HQTV_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
HQTV_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
HQTV_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
HQTV_arctic_b0469 very few people knew of the existence of this law
HQTV_arctic_a0168 the low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting
HQTV_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
HQTV_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
HQTV_arctic_b0534 i'll tell you the librarian said with a brightening face
HQTV_arctic_a0094 he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
HQTV_arctic_b0019 his slim hands gripped the edges of the table
HQTV_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
HQTV_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
HQTV_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
HQTV_arctic_a0139 he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
HQTV_arctic_a0026 it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
HQTV_arctic_a0041 meanwhile i'll go out to breathe a spell
HQTV_arctic_a0099 a maddening joy pounded in his brain
HQTV_arctic_a0108 he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
HQTV_arctic_b0315 and this was their sole conversation throughout the meal
HQTV_arctic_a0013 he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
HQTV_arctic_a0104 she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
HQTV_arctic_a0121 they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
HQTV_arctic_a0054 there was nothing on the rock
HQTV_arctic_a0063 yes it was a man who asked a stranger
HQTV_arctic_a0209 it was not a large lake and almost round
HQTV_arctic_b0518 but there was also talk of witchcraft in the village
HQTV_arctic_a0364 we have plenty of capital ourselves and yet we want more
HQTV_arctic_a0542 without a doubt some of them have dinner engagements
HQTV_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
HQTV_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
HQTV_arctic_a0260 nobody knew his history they of the junta least of all
HQTV_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
HQTV_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
HQTV_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
HQTV_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
HQTV_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
HQTV_arctic_b0201 i also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in europe
HQTV_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
HQTV_arctic_b0416 i arose obediently and went down the beach
HQTV_arctic_b0192 outsiders are allowed five minute speeches the sick man urged
HQTV_arctic_b0380 he had peeled off his shirt and was wildly waving it
HQTV_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
HQTV_arctic_a0519 such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land
HQTV_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
HQTV_arctic_b0509 he had fulfilled his duty and paid properly
HQTV_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i'll go on seeing them forever
HQTV_arctic_b0415 there was nothing for us but the wide raw ocean
HQTV_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
HQTV_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
HQTV_arctic_b0342 each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up
HQTV_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
HQTV_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
HQTV_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
HQTV_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
HQTV_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
HQTV_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
HQTV_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
HQTV_arctic_a0225 i was brought up the way most girls in hawaii are brought up
HQTV_arctic_b0320 the regret in his voice was provocative of a second burst of laughter
HQTV_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
HQTV_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
HQTV_arctic_b0355 there was proper division of labor in the work they individually performed
HQTV_arctic_a0459 there's too much of the schoolboy in me
HQTV_arctic_a0102 he will follow us soon
HQTV_arctic_a0271 now please give a plain statement of what occurred
HQTV_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
HQTV_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quietly as he had come
HQTV_arctic_b0488 beyond refusing to sell us food they left us to ourselves
HQTV_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
HQTV_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
HQTV_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
HQTV_arctic_b0425 there were orange green gold green and a copper green
HQTV_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
HQTV_arctic_b0048 he looked like one who had passed through an uncomfortable hour or two
HQTV_arctic_b0503 the scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land
HQTV_arctic_b0165 he pulled and the log crashed down to break his back
HQTV_arctic_b0304 his previous wives had never lived long enough to bear him children
HQTV_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
HQTV_arctic_b0393 i was still weak from my prolonged immersion
HQTV_arctic_a0038 we'll have to watch our chances
HQTV_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting
HQTV_arctic_a0105 only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
HQTV_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
HQTV_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
HQTV_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud 
HQTV_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
HQTV_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
HQTV_arctic_a0178 every bone in her aged body seemed broken and dislocated
HQTV_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
HQTV_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
HQTV_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
HQTV_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
HQTV_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
HQTV_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
HQTV_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
HQTV_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
HQTV_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
HQTV_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
HQTV_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
HQTV_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
HQTV_arctic_a0375 the butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants
HQTV_arctic_b0422 this was when the explosion occurred
HQTV_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
HQTV_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
LXC_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
LXC_arctic_b0189 this is what distinguishes all of us from the lower animals
LXC_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
LXC_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
LXC_arctic_b0288 we would not spend another such night
LXC_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
LXC_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
LXC_arctic_a0515 but here amongst ourselves let us speak out
LXC_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
LXC_arctic_b0531 i'm sure it must have been some adventure
LXC_arctic_b0465 but such divergence of opinion would constitute no menace to society
LXC_arctic_b0479 violation of this law was made a high misdemeanor and punished accordingly
LXC_arctic_b0251 they must have been swept away by the chaotic currents
LXC_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
LXC_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
LXC_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
LXC_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
LXC_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
LXC_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
LXC_arctic_b0527 the very idea of it was preposterous
LXC_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
LXC_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened
LXC_arctic_a0549 do you know that we weigh every pound of coal we burn
LXC_arctic_b0481 the task we set ourselves was threefold
LXC_arctic_a0075 there has been a change she interrupted him
LXC_arctic_a0090 the singing voice approached rapidly
LXC_arctic_a0029 their forces were already moving into the north country
LXC_arctic_a0027 to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
LXC_arctic_a0018 there was a change now
LXC_arctic_a0536 he would destroy all things that are fixed
LXC_arctic_a0134 he obeyed the pressure of her hand
LXC_arctic_b0026 you have associated with some of these men
LXC_arctic_a0434 a half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds
LXC_arctic_a0112 he was wounded in the arm
LXC_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
LXC_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
LXC_arctic_a0576 and the big persian knew of his existence before he did of hers
LXC_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
LXC_arctic_b0075 in that case he could not miss them if he used caution
LXC_arctic_b0074 yet behind them there was another and more powerful motive
LXC_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
LXC_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
LXC_arctic_b0323 crickets began to chirp and more geese and ducks flew overhead
LXC_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
LXC_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
LXC_arctic_b0358 the temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip
LXC_arctic_b0140 they edged nearer and stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world
LXC_arctic_b0385 last night he showed all the symptoms of coming down with pneumonia
LXC_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
LXC_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
LXC_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
LXC_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
LXC_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
LXC_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
LXC_arctic_b0004 when i can't see beauty in woman i want to die
LXC_arctic_b0282 some of the smaller veins had doubtless been ruptured
LXC_arctic_a0094 he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
LXC_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
LXC_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
LXC_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
LXC_arctic_a0139 he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
LXC_arctic_a0026 it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
LXC_arctic_a0041 meanwhile i'll go out to breathe a spell
LXC_arctic_a0099 a maddening joy pounded in his brain
LXC_arctic_a0108 he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
LXC_arctic_a0013 he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
LXC_arctic_a0571 he had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out
LXC_arctic_b0483 the flower of the artistic and intellectual world were revolutionists
LXC_arctic_a0104 she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
LXC_arctic_a0121 they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
LXC_arctic_a0054 there was nothing on the rock
LXC_arctic_a0063 yes it was a man who asked a stranger
LXC_arctic_a0245 out of his eighteen hundred he laid aside sixteen hundred each year
LXC_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
LXC_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
LXC_arctic_a0335 red eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down
LXC_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
LXC_arctic_b0418 at that moment i got the impression that she was willowy
LXC_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
LXC_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
LXC_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
LXC_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
LXC_arctic_b0142 something vastly more thrilling had come into it now
LXC_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
LXC_arctic_b0416 i arose obediently and went down the beach
LXC_arctic_a0575 there weren't any missions and he was the man to know
LXC_arctic_b0380 he had peeled off his shirt and was wildly waving it
LXC_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
LXC_arctic_a0519 such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land
LXC_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
LXC_arctic_b0509 he had fulfilled his duty and paid properly
LXC_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i'll go on seeing them forever
LXC_arctic_b0185 your being wrecked here has been a godsend to me
LXC_arctic_b0415 there was nothing for us but the wide raw ocean
LXC_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
LXC_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
LXC_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
LXC_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
LXC_arctic_b0430 they were babbling and chattering all together
LXC_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
LXC_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
LXC_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
LXC_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
LXC_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores

LXC_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
LXC_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
LXC_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
LXC_arctic_b0476 the reorganization of these countries took the form of revolution
LXC_arctic_b0456 he was an amphibian and a mountaineer
LXC_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
LXC_arctic_b0048 he looked like one who had passed through an uncomfortable hour or two
LXC_arctic_b0165 he pulled and the log crashed down to break his back
LXC_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
LXC_arctic_b0393 i was still weak from my prolonged immersion
LXC_arctic_a0038 we'll have to watch our chances
LXC_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting

LXC_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
LXC_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
LXC_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud 
LXC_arctic_a0078 then at supper he tried to fathom her
LXC_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
LXC_arctic_b0400 how could i answer the question on the spur of the moment
LXC_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
LXC_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
LXC_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
LXC_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
LXC_arctic_b0366 i forgot how easily i had taught myself from the printed page
LXC_arctic_b0402 an altruistic act is an act performed for the welfare of others
LXC_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
LXC_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
LXC_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
LXC_arctic_b0461 by virtue of that power we shall remain in power
LXC_arctic_b0203 a month in australia would finish me
LXC_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
LXC_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
LXC_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
LXC_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
LXC_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
LXC_arctic_b0422 this was when the explosion occurred
LXC_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
LXC_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
ERMS_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
ERMS_arctic_a0299 i tell you i am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot
ERMS_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
ERMS_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
ERMS_arctic_b0070 there was no chance to fire without hitting him
ERMS_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
ERMS_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
ERMS_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
ERMS_arctic_a0227 it was the same way with our revolvers and rifles
ERMS_arctic_b0150 and he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear
ERMS_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
ERMS_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
ERMS_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
ERMS_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
ERMS_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
ERMS_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
ERMS_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
ERMS_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened
ERMS_arctic_a0148 now these things had been struck dead within him
ERMS_arctic_a0075 there has been a change she interrupted him
ERMS_arctic_a0090 the singing voice approached rapidly
ERMS_arctic_a0029 their forces were already moving into the north country
ERMS_arctic_a0027 to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
ERMS_arctic_a0018 there was a change now
ERMS_arctic_a0134 he obeyed the pressure of her hand
ERMS_arctic_a0191 for a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone
ERMS_arctic_a0112 he was wounded in the arm
ERMS_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
ERMS_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
ERMS_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
ERMS_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
ERMS_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
ERMS_arctic_a0176 for the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap
ERMS_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
ERMS_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
ERMS_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
ERMS_arctic_b0279 he gave one last snarl and slid from view among the trees
ERMS_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
ERMS_arctic_a0295 and twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows
ERMS_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
ERMS_arctic_a0500 who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury
ERMS_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
ERMS_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
ERMS_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
ERMS_arctic_b0534 i'll tell you the librarian said with a brightening face
ERMS_arctic_a0401 the man smiled grimly and brought a hatchet and a club
ERMS_arctic_a0416 the added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour
ERMS_arctic_a0094 he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
ERMS_arctic_a0548 also churches and preachers i had never known
ERMS_arctic_b0019 his slim hands gripped the edges of the table
ERMS_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
ERMS_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
ERMS_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
ERMS_arctic_a0139 he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
ERMS_arctic_a0026 it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
ERMS_arctic_b0042 ten minutes had not elapsed since he had dropped the handkerchief
ERMS_arctic_b0298 his hand shot out and clutched crooked leg by the neck
ERMS_arctic_b0187 her achievements with cocoanuts were a revelation
ERMS_arctic_a0041 meanwhile i'll go out to breathe a spell
ERMS_arctic_a0099 a maddening joy pounded in his brain
ERMS_arctic_a0185 the questions may have come vaguely in his mind
ERMS_arctic_a0108 he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
ERMS_arctic_a0013 he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
ERMS_arctic_a0104 she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
ERMS_arctic_a0121 they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
ERMS_arctic_a0054 there was nothing on the rock
ERMS_arctic_a0303 but they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality
ERMS_arctic_a0063 yes it was a man who asked a stranger
ERMS_arctic_a0265 the discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment
ERMS_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
ERMS_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
ERMS_arctic_a0556 why he's bought forty pounds of goods from you already
ERMS_arctic_a0260 nobody knew his history they of the junta least of all
ERMS_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
ERMS_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
ERMS_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
ERMS_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
ERMS_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
ERMS_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
ERMS_arctic_b0269 why not like any railroad station or ferry depot
ERMS_arctic_b0413 he may desire to escape pain or to enjoy pleasure
ERMS_arctic_b0494 never so strange a prophet came up to jerusalem
ERMS_arctic_b0434 the steward has just tendered me a respectful bit of advice
ERMS_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
ERMS_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
ERMS_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i'll go on seeing them forever
ERMS_arctic_a0210 its diameter was not more than two hundred yards
ERMS_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
ERMS_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
ERMS_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
ERMS_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
ERMS_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
ERMS_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
ERMS_arctic_a0159 they look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life
ERMS_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
ERMS_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
ERMS_arctic_a0269 that's where they cut off the scottish chiefs and killed all hands
ERMS_arctic_a0369 in partnership with daylight the pair raided the san jose interurban
ERMS_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
ERMS_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
ERMS_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
ERMS_arctic_a0102 he will follow us soon
ERMS_arctic_a0198 sometimes her dreams were filled with visions
ERMS_arctic_a0271 now please give a plain statement of what occurred
ERMS_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
ERMS_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quietly as he had come
ERMS_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
ERMS_arctic_a0154 he was smooth shaven and his hair and eyes were black
ERMS_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
ERMS_arctic_a0300 from my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror
ERMS_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
ERMS_arctic_a0212 fresh cases still able to walk they clustered about the spokesman
ERMS_arctic_a0363 it is not an attempt to smash the market
ERMS_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
ERMS_arctic_b0503 the scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land
ERMS_arctic_b0304 his previous wives had never lived long enough to bear him children
ERMS_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
ERMS_arctic_a0233 i never allow what can't be changed to annoy me
ERMS_arctic_a0145 i have to be careful of them as they tear very easily
ERMS_arctic_a0038 we'll have to watch our chances
ERMS_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting
ERMS_arctic_a0105 only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
ERMS_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
ERMS_arctic_a0441 violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me
ERMS_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
ERMS_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud 
ERMS_arctic_a0298 this tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave saxon a little joy thrill
ERMS_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
ERMS_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
ERMS_arctic_a0178 every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated
ERMS_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
ERMS_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
ERMS_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
ERMS_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
ERMS_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
ERMS_arctic_b0538 at the best they were necessary accessories
ERMS_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
ERMS_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
ERMS_arctic_a0254 straight out they swam their heads growing smaller and smaller
ERMS_arctic_a0487 the river bared its bosom and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness
ERMS_arctic_b0461 by virtue of that power we shall remain in power
ERMS_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
ERMS_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
ERMS_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
ERMS_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
ERMS_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
ERMS_arctic_a0170 there was none of the joy of meeting in his face
ERMS_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
ERMS_arctic_a0320 with my strength i slammed it full into red eye's face
ERMS_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
BWC_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
BWC_arctic_b0189 that is what distinguishes all of us from the lower animals
BWC_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
BWC_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
BWC_arctic_b0288 we would not spend another such night
BWC_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
BWC_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
BWC_arctic_a0515 but here amongst ourselves let us speak out
BWC_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
BWC_arctic_b0531 i'm sure it must have been some adventure
BWC_arctic_b0465 but such divergence of opinion would constitute no menace to society
BWC_arctic_b0479 violation of this law was made a high misdemeanor and punished accordingly
BWC_arctic_b0251 they must have been swept away by the chaotic currents
BWC_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
BWC_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
BWC_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
BWC_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
BWC_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
BWC_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
BWC_arctic_b0527 the very idea of it was preposterous
BWC_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
BWC_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened
BWC_arctic_a0549 do you know that we weigh every pound of coal we burn
BWC_arctic_b0481 the task we set ourselves was threefold
BWC_arctic_a0075 there has been a change she interrupted him
BWC_arctic_a0090 the singing voice approached rapidly
BWC_arctic_a0029 their forces were already moving into the north country
BWC_arctic_a0027 to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
BWC_arctic_a0018 there was a change now
BWC_arctic_a0536 he would destroy all things that are fixed
BWC_arctic_a0134 he obeyed the pressure of her hand
BWC_arctic_b0026 you have associated with some of these men
BWC_arctic_a0434 a half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds
BWC_arctic_a0112 he was wounded in the arm
BWC_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
BWC_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
BWC_arctic_a0576 and the big persian knew of his existence before he did of hers
BWC_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
BWC_arctic_b0075 in that case he could not miss them if he used caution
BWC_arctic_b0074 yet behind them there was another and more powerful motive
BWC_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
BWC_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
BWC_arctic_b0323 crickets began to chirp and more geese and ducks flew overhead
BWC_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
BWC_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
BWC_arctic_b0358 the temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip
BWC_arctic_b0140 they edged nearer and stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world
BWC_arctic_b0385 last night he showed all the symptoms of coming down with pneumonia
BWC_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
BWC_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
BWC_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
BWC_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
BWC_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
BWC_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
BWC_arctic_b0004 when i can't see beauty in woman i want to die
BWC_arctic_b0282 some of the smaller veins had doubtless been ruptured
BWC_arctic_a0094 he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
BWC_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
BWC_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
BWC_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
BWC_arctic_a0139 he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
BWC_arctic_a0026 it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
BWC_arctic_a0041 meanwhile i will go out to breathe a spell
BWC_arctic_a0099 a maddening joy pounded in his brain
BWC_arctic_a0108 he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
BWC_arctic_a0013 he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
BWC_arctic_a0571 he had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out
BWC_arctic_b0483 the flower of the artistic and intellectual world were revolutionists
BWC_arctic_a0104 she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
BWC_arctic_a0121 they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
BWC_arctic_a0054 there was nothing on the rock
BWC_arctic_a0063 yes it was a man who asked a stranger
BWC_arctic_a0245 out of his eighteen hundred he laid aside sixteen hundred each year
BWC_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
BWC_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
BWC_arctic_a0335 red eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down
BWC_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
BWC_arctic_b0418 at that moment i got the impression that she was willowy
BWC_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
BWC_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
BWC_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
BWC_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
BWC_arctic_b0142 something vastly more thrilling had come into it now
BWC_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
BWC_arctic_b0416 i arose obediently and went down the beach
BWC_arctic_a0575 there weren't any missions and he was the man to know
BWC_arctic_b0380 he had peeled off his shirt and was wildly waving it
BWC_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
BWC_arctic_a0519 such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land
BWC_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
BWC_arctic_b0509 he had fulfilled his duty and paid properly
BWC_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i will go on seeing them forever
BWC_arctic_b0185 your being wrecked here has been a godsend to me
BWC_arctic_b0415 there was nothing for us but the wide raw ocean
BWC_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
BWC_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
BWC_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
BWC_arctic_a0131 philip had delivered himself through the maelstrom
BWC_arctic_b0430 they were babbling and chattering all together
BWC_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
BWC_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
BWC_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
BWC_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
BWC_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
BWC_arctic_a0225 i was brought up the way most girls in hawaii are brought up
BWC_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
BWC_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
BWC_arctic_a0459 there's too much of the schoolboy in me
BWC_arctic_a0102 he will follow us soon
BWC_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
BWC_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quietly as he had come
BWC_arctic_b0488 beyond refusing to sell us food they left us to ourselves
BWC_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
BWC_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
BWC_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
BWC_arctic_b0476 the reorganization of these countries took the form of revolution
BWC_arctic_b0456 he was an amphibian and a mountaineer
BWC_arctic_a0116 it was the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
BWC_arctic_b0048 he looked like one who had passed through an uncomfortable hour or two
BWC_arctic_b0165 he pulled and the log crashed down to break his back
BWC_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
BWC_arctic_b0393 i was still weak from my prolonged immersion
BWC_arctic_a0038 we will have to watch our chances
BWC_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting
BWC_arctic_a0105 only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
BWC_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
BWC_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
BWC_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud 
BWC_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
BWC_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
BWC_arctic_b0400 how could i answer the question on the spur of the moment
BWC_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
BWC_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
BWC_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
BWC_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
BWC_arctic_b0366 i forgot how easily i had taught myself from the printed page
BWC_arctic_b0402 an altruistic act is an act performed for the welfare of others
BWC_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
BWC_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
BWC_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
BWC_arctic_b0461 by virtue of that power we shall remain in power
BWC_arctic_b0203 a month in australia would finish me
BWC_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
BWC_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
BWC_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
BWC_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
BWC_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
BWC_arctic_b0422 this was when the explosion occurred
BWC_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
BWC_arctic_a0081 what if she didn't come to the rock
EBVS_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
EBVS_arctic_a0299 i tell you i am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot
EBVS_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
EBVS_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
EBVS_arctic_b0070 there was no chance to fire without hitting him
EBVS_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
EBVS_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
EBVS_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
EBVS_arctic_a0227 it was the same way with our revolvers and rifles
EBVS_arctic_b0150 and he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear
EBVS_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
EBVS_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
EBVS_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
EBVS_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
EBVS_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
EBVS_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
EBVS_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
EBVS_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened
EBVS_arctic_a0148 now these things had been struck dead within him
EBVS_arctic_a0075 there has been a change she interrupted him
EBVS_arctic_a0090 the singing voice approached rapidly
EBVS_arctic_a0029 their forces were already moving into the north country
EBVS_arctic_a0027 to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
EBVS_arctic_a0018 there was a change now
EBVS_arctic_a0134 he obeyed the pressure of her hand
EBVS_arctic_a0191 for a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone
EBVS_arctic_a0112 he was wounded in the arm
EBVS_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
EBVS_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
EBVS_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
EBVS_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
EBVS_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
EBVS_arctic_a0176 for the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap
EBVS_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
EBVS_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
EBVS_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
EBVS_arctic_b0279 he gave one last snarl and slid from view among the trees
EBVS_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
EBVS_arctic_a0295 and twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows
EBVS_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
EBVS_arctic_a0500 who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury
EBVS_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
EBVS_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
EBVS_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
EBVS_arctic_b0534 i'll tell you the librarian said with a brightening face
EBVS_arctic_a0401 the man smiled grimly and brought a hatchet and a club
EBVS_arctic_a0416 the added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour
EBVS_arctic_a0094 he had barely entered this when he saw he the glow the glow of a fire
EBVS_arctic_a0548 also churches and preachers i had never known
EBVS_arctic_b0019 his slim hands gripped the edges of the table
EBVS_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
EBVS_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
EBVS_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
EBVS_arctic_a0139 he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
EBVS_arctic_a0026 it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
EBVS_arctic_b0042 ten minutes had not elapsed since he had dropped the handkerchief
EBVS_arctic_b0298 his hand shot out and clutched crooked leg by the neck
EBVS_arctic_b0187 her achievements with cocoanuts were a revelation
EBVS_arctic_a0041 meanwhile i'll go out to breathe a spell
EBVS_arctic_a0099 a maddening joy pounded in his brain
EBVS_arctic_a0185 the questions may have come vaguely in his mind
EBVS_arctic_a0108 he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
EBVS_arctic_a0013 he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
EBVS_arctic_a0104 she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
EBVS_arctic_a0121 they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
EBVS_arctic_a0054 there was nothing on the rock
EBVS_arctic_a0303 but they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality
EBVS_arctic_a0063 yes it was a man who asked a stranger
EBVS_arctic_a0265 the discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment
EBVS_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
EBVS_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
EBVS_arctic_a0556 why he's bought forty pounds of goods from you already
EBVS_arctic_a0260 nobody knew his history they of the junta least of all
EBVS_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
EBVS_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
EBVS_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
EBVS_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
EBVS_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
EBVS_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
EBVS_arctic_b0269 why not any railroad station or ferry depot
EBVS_arctic_b0413 he may desire to escape pain or to enjoy pleasure
EBVS_arctic_b0494 never so strange a prophet came up to jerusalem
EBVS_arctic_b0434 the steward has just tendered me a respectful bit of advice
EBVS_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
EBVS_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
EBVS_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i'll go on seeing them forever
EBVS_arctic_a0210 its diameter was not more than two hundred yards
EBVS_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
EBVS_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
EBVS_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
EBVS_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
EBVS_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
EBVS_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
EBVS_arctic_a0159 they look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life
EBVS_arctic_a0023 a combination of capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
EBVS_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
EBVS_arctic_a0269 that's where they cut off the scottish chiefs and killed all hands
EBVS_arctic_a0369 in partnership with daylight the pair raided the san jose interurban
EBVS_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
EBVS_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
EBVS_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
EBVS_arctic_a0102 he will follow us soon
EBVS_arctic_a0198 sometimes her dreams were filled with visions
EBVS_arctic_a0271 now please give a plain statement of what occurred
EBVS_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
EBVS_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quickly as he had come
EBVS_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
EBVS_arctic_a0154 he was smooth shaven and his hair and eyes were black
EBVS_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
EBVS_arctic_a0300 from my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror
EBVS_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
EBVS_arctic_a0212 fresh cases still able to walk they clustered about the spokesman
EBVS_arctic_a0363 it is not an attempt to smash the market
EBVS_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
EBVS_arctic_b0503 the scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land
EBVS_arctic_b0304 his previous wives had never lived long enough to bear him children
EBVS_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
EBVS_arctic_a0233 i never allow what can't be changed to annoy me
EBVS_arctic_a0145 i have to be careful of them as they tear very easily
EBVS_arctic_a0038 we'll have to watch our chances
EBVS_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting
EBVS_arctic_a0105 only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
EBVS_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
EBVS_arctic_a0441 violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me
EBVS_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
EBVS_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud 
EBVS_arctic_a0298 this tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave saxon a little joy thrill
EBVS_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
EBVS_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
EBVS_arctic_a0178 every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated
EBVS_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
EBVS_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
EBVS_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
EBVS_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
EBVS_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
EBVS_arctic_b0538 at the best they were necessary accessories
EBVS_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
EBVS_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
EBVS_arctic_a0254 straight out they swam their heads growing smaller and smaller
EBVS_arctic_a0487 the river bared its bosom and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness
EBVS_arctic_b0461 by virtue of that power we shall remain in power
EBVS_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
EBVS_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
EBVS_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
EBVS_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
EBVS_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
EBVS_arctic_a0170 there was none of the joy of meeting in his face
EBVS_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
EBVS_arctic_a0320 with my strength i slammed it full into red eye's face
EBVS_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
HJK_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
HJK_arctic_a0475 his outstretched arm dropped to his side and he paused
HJK_arctic_b0386 my idea was that he would have more influence over the natives
HJK_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
HJK_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
HJK_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
HJK_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
HJK_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
HJK_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
HJK_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
HJK_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
HJK_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
HJK_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
HJK_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
HJK_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
HJK_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened
HJK_arctic_a0148 now these things had been struck dead within him
HJK_arctic_a0075 there has been a change she interrupted him
HJK_arctic_a0090 the singing voice approached rapidly
HJK_arctic_a0029 their forces were already moving into the north country
HJK_arctic_a0027 to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
HJK_arctic_a0018 there was a change now
HJK_arctic_a0378 that's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged
HJK_arctic_a0134 he obeyed the pressure of her hand
HJK_arctic_a0112 he was wounded in the arm
HJK_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
HJK_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
HJK_arctic_b0225 the president of the united states was his friend
HJK_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
HJK_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
HJK_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
HJK_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
HJK_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
HJK_arctic_b0106 for a full minute the two men stared into each other's face
HJK_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
HJK_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
HJK_arctic_b0238 the very thought of the effort to swim over was nauseating
HJK_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
HJK_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
HJK_arctic_b0469 very few people knew of the existence of this law
HJK_arctic_a0168 a low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting
HJK_arctic_b0530 he had a big chimpanzee that was a winner
HJK_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
HJK_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
HJK_arctic_a0272 you can take a vacation on pay
HJK_arctic_a0416 the added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour
HJK_arctic_a0094 he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
HJK_arctic_b0019 his slim hands gripped the edges of the table
HJK_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
HJK_arctic_a0442 you live on an income which your father earned
HJK_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
HJK_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
HJK_arctic_a0139 he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
HJK_arctic_a0026 it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
HJK_arctic_a0041 meanwhile i'll go out to breathe a spell
HJK_arctic_a0099 a maddening joy pounded in his brain
HJK_arctic_a0108 he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
HJK_arctic_b0315 and this was their sole conversation throughout the meal
HJK_arctic_b0215 it is a good property and worth more than that
HJK_arctic_a0013 he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
HJK_arctic_a0104 she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
HJK_arctic_a0121 they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
HJK_arctic_a0054 there was nothing on the rock
HJK_arctic_a0303 but they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality
HJK_arctic_a0063 yes it was a man who asked a stranger
HJK_arctic_a0143 ah i had forgotten he exclaimed
HJK_arctic_a0209 it was not a large lake and almost round
HJK_arctic_b0518 but there was also talk of witchcraft in the village
HJK_arctic_a0364 we have plenty of capital ourselves and yet we want more
HJK_arctic_a0542 without a doubt some of them have dinner engagements
HJK_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
HJK_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
HJK_arctic_a0260 nobody knew his history they of the junta least of all
HJK_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
HJK_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
HJK_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
HJK_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
HJK_arctic_b0266 and now put yourself in my place for a moment
HJK_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
HJK_arctic_b0201 i also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in europe
HJK_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
HJK_arctic_b0192 outsiders are allowed five minute speeches the sick man urged
HJK_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
HJK_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
HJK_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i'll go on seeing them forever
HJK_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
HJK_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
HJK_arctic_b0342 each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up
HJK_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
HJK_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
HJK_arctic_b0143 it took him half an hour to reach the edge of it
HJK_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
HJK_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
HJK_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
HJK_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
HJK_arctic_a0369 in partnership with daylight the pair raided the san jose interurban
HJK_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
HJK_arctic_b0320 the regret in his voice was provocative of a second burst of laughter
HJK_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
HJK_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
HJK_arctic_b0355 there was proper division of labor in the work they individually performed
HJK_arctic_a0102 he will follow us soon
HJK_arctic_a0271 now please give a plain statement of what occurred
HJK_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
HJK_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quietly as he had come
HJK_arctic_a0365 these rumors may even originate with us
HJK_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
HJK_arctic_a0384 the farmer works the soil and produces grain
HJK_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
HJK_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
HJK_arctic_a0495 he bore no grudges and had few enemies
HJK_arctic_b0425 there were orange green gold green and a copper green
HJK_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
HJK_arctic_b0197 the planters are already considering the matter
HJK_arctic_b0068 only the chance sound had led him to observe them
HJK_arctic_b0503 the scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land
HJK_arctic_b0304 his previous wives had never lived long enough to bear him children
HJK_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
HJK_arctic_a0233 i never allow what can't be changed to annoy me
HJK_arctic_a0145 i have to be careful of them as they tear very easily
HJK_arctic_a0038 we'll have to watch our chances
HJK_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting
HJK_arctic_a0105 only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
HJK_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
HJK_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
HJK_arctic_a0144 but there was something even more startling than this resemblance
HJK_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud 
HJK_arctic_b0022 if i was out of the game it would be easily made
HJK_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
HJK_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
HJK_arctic_a0178 every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated
HJK_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
HJK_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
HJK_arctic_a0379 how old are you daddy
HJK_arctic_b0047 suppose you saw me at work through the window
HJK_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
HJK_arctic_a0258 soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays
HJK_arctic_a0345 she was trying to pass the apron string around him
HJK_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
HJK_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
HJK_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
HJK_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
HJK_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
HJK_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
HJK_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
HJK_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
HJK_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
HJK_arctic_a0375 the butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants
HJK_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
HJK_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
SKA_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
SKA_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
SKA_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
SKA_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
SKA_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
SKA_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
SKA_arctic_b0150 and he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear
SKA_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
SKA_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
SKA_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
SKA_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
SKA_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
SKA_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
SKA_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
SKA_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened
SKA_arctic_a0075 there has been a change she interrupted him
SKA_arctic_a0090 the singing voice approached rapidly
SKA_arctic_a0029 their forces were already moving into the north country
SKA_arctic_a0027 to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
SKA_arctic_a0018 there was a change now
SKA_arctic_a0134 he obeyed the pressure of her hand
SKA_arctic_a0112 he was wounded in the arm
SKA_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
SKA_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
SKA_arctic_b0455 his reward should have been peace and repose
SKA_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
SKA_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
SKA_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
SKA_arctic_b0444 he did not know what went on in the minds of his superiors
SKA_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
SKA_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
SKA_arctic_b0106 for a full minute the two men stared into each other's face
SKA_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
SKA_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
SKA_arctic_b0103 he lifted his eyes and a strange cry burst from his lips
SKA_arctic_b0340 these quick little joys of hers were sources of joy to him
SKA_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
SKA_arctic_a0500 who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury
SKA_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
SKA_arctic_b0469 very few people knew of the existence of this law
SKA_arctic_a0529 as i say he had tapped the message very rapidly
SKA_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
SKA_arctic_b0016 he chuckled as he pulled out his pipe and began filling it
SKA_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
SKA_arctic_b0534 i'll tell you the librarian said with a brightening face
SKA_arctic_b0490 what an excited whispering and conferring took place
SKA_arctic_a0094 he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
SKA_arctic_a0548 also churches and preachers i had never known
SKA_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
SKA_arctic_a0461 ah we were very close together in that moment
SKA_arctic_b0433 we are cooking on the coal stove and on the oil burners
SKA_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
SKA_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
SKA_arctic_a0139 he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
SKA_arctic_a0026 it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
SKA_arctic_a0041 meanwhile i'll go out to breathe a spell
SKA_arctic_a0099 a maddening joy pounded in his brain
SKA_arctic_b0307 we got few vegetables and fruits and became fish eaters
SKA_arctic_a0108 he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
SKA_arctic_a0013 he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
SKA_arctic_a0104 she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
SKA_arctic_a0121 they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
SKA_arctic_a0054 there was nothing on the rock
SKA_arctic_a0063 yes it was a man who asked a stranger

SKA_arctic_b0518 but there was also talk of witchcraft in the village
SKA_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
SKA_arctic_a0501 you're joking me sir the other managed to articulate
SKA_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
SKA_arctic_b0158 she obeyed shrinking back with the baby in her arms
SKA_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
SKA_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
SKA_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
SKA_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
SKA_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
SKA_arctic_b0504 the life there was healthful and athletic but too juvenile
SKA_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
SKA_arctic_b0367 any average young fellow can teach himself in a week
SKA_arctic_b0413 he may desire to escape pain or to enjoy pleasure
SKA_arctic_b0494 never so strange a prophet came up to jerusalem
SKA_arctic_b0495 we who have endured so much surely can endure a little more
SKA_arctic_b0434 the steward has just tendered me a respectful bit of advice
SKA_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
SKA_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
SKA_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope iwill go on seeing them forever
SKA_arctic_b0438 they ran the canoe in and climbed the high earth bank
SKA_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
SKA_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
SKA_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
SKA_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
SKA_arctic_a0257 they are coming ashore whoever they are
SKA_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
SKA_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
SKA_arctic_a0159 they look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life
SKA_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
SKA_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
SKA_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
SKA_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
SKA_arctic_b0146 after all it was simply a mistake in judgment
SKA_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy

SKA_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
SKA_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quietly as he had come
SKA_arctic_b0452 they saw each other for the first time in boston
SKA_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
SKA_arctic_b0324 not till the twentieth of may did the river break
SKA_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
SKA_arctic_a0300 from my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror
SKA_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
SKA_arctic_b0425 there were orange green gold green and a copper green
SKA_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
SKA_arctic_b0126 blood was oozing slowly from the wounded man's right breast
SKA_arctic_b0424 it is a very tenable hypothesis and will bear looking into
SKA_arctic_b0068 only the chance sound had led him to observe them
SKA_arctic_b0503 the scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land
SKA_arctic_b0432 he is a candidate rising from the serf class to our class
SKA_arctic_b0492 thus he turned the tenets and jargon of psychology back on me
SKA_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
SKA_arctic_a0038 we'll have to watch our chances
SKA_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting
SKA_arctic_a0105 only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
SKA_arctic_b0348 would you be satisfied with that one hundredth part of me
SKA_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
SKA_arctic_a0426 they do not know the length of time of incubation
SKA_arctic_a0441 violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me
SKA_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
SKA_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud 
SKA_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
SKA_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence

SKA_arctic_a0379 how old are you daddy
SKA_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
SKA_arctic_b0428 the history of our westward faring race is written in it
SKA_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
SKA_arctic_b0310 a little treatment massage with some help from the doctor
SKA_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
SKA_arctic_b0538 at the best they were necessary accessories
SKA_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
SKA_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
SKA_arctic_b0461 by virtue of that power we shall remain in power
SKA_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
SKA_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
SKA_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
SKA_arctic_b0083 in it there was something that was almost tragedy
SKA_arctic_b0506 it would help to tide me along until i got steady employment
SKA_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
SKA_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
SKA_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
SKA_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
ABA_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
ABA_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
ABA_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
ABA_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days

ABA_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
ABA_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
ABA_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
ABA_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened

ABA_arctic_b0367 any average young fellow can teach himself in a week
ABA_arctic_b0413 he may desire to escape pain or to enjoy pleasure
ABA_arctic_b0494 never so strange a prophet came up to jerusalem
ABA_arctic_b0495 we who have endured so much surely can endure a little more
ABA_arctic_b0434 the steward has just tendered me a respectful bit of advice
ABA_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
ABA_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
ABA_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i'll go on seeing them forever
ABA_arctic_b0438 they ran the canoe in and climbed the high earth bank
ABA_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
ABA_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
ABA_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
ABA_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
ABA_arctic_a0257 they are coming ashore whoever they are
ABA_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
ABA_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
ABA_arctic_a0159 they look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life
ABA_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
ABA_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
ABA_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
ABA_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
ABA_arctic_b0146 after all it was simply a mistake in judgment
ABA_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
ABA_arctic_a0102 he will follow us soon
ABA_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
ABA_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quietly as he had come
ABA_arctic_b0452 they saw each other for the first time in boston
ABA_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
ABA_arctic_b0324 not till the twentieth of may did the river break
ABA_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
ABA_arctic_a0300 from my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror
ABA_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
ABA_arctic_b0425 there were orange green gold green and a copper green
ABA_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
ABA_arctic_b0126 blood was oozing slowly from the wounded man's right breast
ABA_arctic_b0424 it is a very tenable hypothesis and will bear looking into
ABA_arctic_b0068 only the chance sound had led him to observe them
ABA_arctic_b0503 the scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land
ABA_arctic_b0432 he is a candidate rising from the serf class to our class
ABA_arctic_b0492 thus he turned the tenets and jargon of psychology back on me
ABA_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
ABA_arctic_a0038 we will have to watch our chances
ABA_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting
ABA_arctic_a0105 only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
ABA_arctic_b0348 would you be satisfied with that one hundredth part of me
ABA_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
ABA_arctic_a0426 they don't know the length of time of incubation
ABA_arctic_a0441 violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me
ABA_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
ABA_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud
ABA_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
ABA_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
ABA_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
ABA_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
ABA_arctic_a0379 how old are you daddy
ABA_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
ABA_arctic_b0428 the history of our westward faring race is written in it
ABA_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
ABA_arctic_b0310 a little treatment massage with some help from the doctor
ABA_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
ABA_arctic_b0538 at the best they were necessary accessories
ABA_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
ABA_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
ABA_arctic_b0461 by virtue of that power we shall remain in power
ABA_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
ABA_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
ABA_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
ABA_arctic_b0083 in it there was something that was almost tragedy
ABA_arctic_b0506 it would help to tide me along until i got steady employment
ABA_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
ABA_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
ABA_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
ABA_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
ASI_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
ASI_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
ASI_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
ASI_arctic_a0199 thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day
ASI_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
ASI_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
ASI_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
ASI_arctic_b0171 he changed his seat for a steamer reclining chair
ASI_arctic_b0396 the pain from my hurt knee was agonizing
ASI_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
ASI_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
ASI_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
ASI_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
ASI_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
ASI_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
ASI_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
ASI_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened
ASI_arctic_a0188 two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass
ASI_arctic_b0002 you got out by fighting and i through a pretty girl
ASI_arctic_b0317 he did not believe in the burning of daylight for such a luxury
ASI_arctic_a0075 there has been a change she interrupted him
ASI_arctic_a0090 the singing voice approached rapidly
ASI_arctic_a0029 their forces were already moving into the north country
ASI_arctic_a0027 to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
ASI_arctic_a0018 there was a change now
ASI_arctic_a0134 he obeyed the pressure of her hand
ASI_arctic_a0191 for a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone
ASI_arctic_a0112 he was wounded in the arm
ASI_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
ASI_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
ASI_arctic_a0301 but all my dreams violated this law
ASI_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
ASI_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
ASI_arctic_b0061 something about it seemed to fascinate him to challenge his presence
ASI_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
ASI_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
ASI_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
ASI_arctic_b0081 you were going to leave after you saw me on the rock
ASI_arctic_b0017 everything was working smoothly better than i had expected
ASI_arctic_a0246 you have heard always how he was the lover of princess naomi
ASI_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
ASI_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
ASI_arctic_b0118 we saw your light and thought you wouldn't mind a call
ASI_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
ASI_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
ASI_arctic_a0168 a low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting
ASI_arctic_b0104 shooting pains passed like flashes of electricity through his body
ASI_arctic_a0424 obviously it was a disease that could be contracted by contact
ASI_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
ASI_arctic_b0089 her beautiful hair was done up in shining coils
ASI_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
ASI_arctic_a0272 you can take a vacation on pay
ASI_arctic_a0416 the added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour
ASI_arctic_a0094 he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
ASI_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
ASI_arctic_b0433 we are cooking on the coal stove and on the oil burners
ASI_arctic_b0136 swiftly his eyes measured the situation
ASI_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
ASI_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
ASI_arctic_a0139 he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
ASI_arctic_a0026 it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
ASI_arctic_a0041 meanwhile i'll go out to breathe a spell
ASI_arctic_a0099 a maddening joy pounded in his brain
ASI_arctic_a0108 he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
ASI_arctic_b0315 and this was their sole conversation throughout the meal
ASI_arctic_b0215 it is a pretty good property and worth more than that
ASI_arctic_a0013 he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
ASI_arctic_a0104 she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
ASI_arctic_a0121 they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
ASI_arctic_a0411 it will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand
ASI_arctic_a0054 there was nothing on the rock
ASI_arctic_a0303 but they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality
ASI_arctic_a0063 yes it was a man who asked a stranger
ASI_arctic_a0214 besides he was paid one case of tobacco per head
ASI_arctic_b0141 it was beating and waiting in the ambush of those black pits
ASI_arctic_b0038 in her haste to get away she had forgotten these things
ASI_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
ASI_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
ASI_arctic_b0158 she obeyed shrinking back with the baby in her arms
ASI_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
ASI_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
ASI_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
ASI_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
ASI_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
ASI_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
ASI_arctic_a0255 you won't die of malnutrition be sure of that
ASI_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
ASI_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
ASI_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i'll go on seeing them forever
ASI_arctic_a0410 so we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well
ASI_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
ASI_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
ASI_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
ASI_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
ASI_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
ASI_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
ASI_arctic_a0159 they look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life
ASI_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
ASI_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
ASI_arctic_a0269 that's where they cut off the scottish chiefs and killed all hands
ASI_arctic_b0160 it was over when he made his way through the ring of spectators
ASI_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
ASI_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
ASI_arctic_b0073 with these arguments he convinced himself that he should go on alone
ASI_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
ASI_arctic_a0102 he will follow us soon
ASI_arctic_a0282 if you mean to insinuate brentwood began hotly
ASI_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
ASI_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quietly as he had come
ASI_arctic_a0292 here in the midmorning the first casualty occurred
ASI_arctic_a0365 these rumors may even originate with us
ASI_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
ASI_arctic_a0384 the farmer works the soil and produces grain
ASI_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
ASI_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
ASI_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
ASI_arctic_b0197 the planters are already considering the matter
ASI_arctic_a0266 they handled two men already both grub thieves
ASI_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
ASI_arctic_a0038 we'll have to watch our chances
ASI_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting
ASI_arctic_a0105 only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
ASI_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
ASI_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
ASI_arctic_a0208 youth had come back to her freed from the yoke of oppression
ASI_arctic_a0144 but there was something even more startling than this resemblance
ASI_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud 
ASI_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
ASI_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
ASI_arctic_a0178 every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated
ASI_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
ASI_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
ASI_arctic_b0047 suppose you saw me at work through the window
ASI_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
ASI_arctic_b0057 they have won popular sentiment through the newspapers
ASI_arctic_a0405 it seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work
ASI_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
ASI_arctic_b0371 yield yourself to the waters that are ripping and tearing at you
ASI_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
ASI_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
ASI_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
ASI_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
ASI_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
ASI_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
ASI_arctic_b0411 he gave no reason but his motive was obvious enough
ASI_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
ASI_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
ASI_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
ASI_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
ASI_arctic_b0321 instead he arrived on the night of the second day
PNV_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
PNV_arctic_b0189 that is what distinguishes all of us from the lower animals
PNV_arctic_a0475 his outstretched arm dropped to his side and he paused
PNV_arctic_b0386 my idea was that he would have more influence over the natives
PNV_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
PNV_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
PNV_arctic_b0288 we would not spend another such night
PNV_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
PNV_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
PNV_arctic_a0515 but here amongst ourselves let us speak out
PNV_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
PNV_arctic_b0465 but such divergence of opinion would constitute no menace to society
PNV_arctic_b0251 they must have been swept away by the chaotic currents
PNV_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
PNV_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
PNV_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
PNV_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
PNV_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
PNV_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
PNV_arctic_b0527 the very idea of it was preposterous
PNV_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
PNV_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened
PNV_arctic_b0481 the task we set ourselves was threefold
PNV_arctic_a0075 there has been a change she interrupted him
PNV_arctic_a0090 the singing voice approached rapidly
PNV_arctic_a0029 their forces were already moving into the north country
PNV_arctic_a0027 to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
PNV_arctic_a0018 there was a change now
PNV_arctic_a0378 that's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged
PNV_arctic_a0134 he obeyed the pressure of her hand
PNV_arctic_a0434 a half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds
PNV_arctic_a0112 he was wounded in the arm
PNV_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
PNV_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
PNV_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
PNV_arctic_b0075 in that case he could not miss them if he used caution
PNV_arctic_b0074 yet behind them there was another and more powerful motive
PNV_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
PNV_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
PNV_arctic_b0323 crickets began to chirp and more geese and ducks flew overhead
PNV_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
PNV_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
PNV_arctic_b0358 the temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip
PNV_arctic_b0140 they edged nearer and stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world
PNV_arctic_b0106 for a full minute the two men stared into each other's face
PNV_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
PNV_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
PNV_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
PNV_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
PNV_arctic_b0469 very few people knew of the existence of this law
PNV_arctic_a0168 a low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting
PNV_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
PNV_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
PNV_arctic_b0534 i'll tell you the librarian said with a brightening face
PNV_arctic_a0094 he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
PNV_arctic_b0019 his slim hands gripped the edges of the table
PNV_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
PNV_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
PNV_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
PNV_arctic_a0139 he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
PNV_arctic_a0026 it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
PNV_arctic_a0041 meanwhile i'll go out to breathe a spell
PNV_arctic_a0099 a maddening joy pounded in his brain
PNV_arctic_a0108 he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
PNV_arctic_b0315 and this was their sole conversation throughout the meal
PNV_arctic_a0013 he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
PNV_arctic_a0104 she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
PNV_arctic_a0121 they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
PNV_arctic_a0054 there was nothing on the rock
PNV_arctic_a0063 yes it was a man who asked a stranger
PNV_arctic_a0209 it was not a large lake and almost round
PNV_arctic_b0518 but there was also talk of witchcraft in the village
PNV_arctic_a0364 we have plenty of capital ourselves and yet we want more
PNV_arctic_a0542 without a doubt some of them have dinner engagements
PNV_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
PNV_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
PNV_arctic_a0260 nobody knew his history they of the junta least of all
PNV_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
PNV_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
PNV_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
PNV_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
PNV_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
PNV_arctic_b0201 i also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in europe
PNV_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
PNV_arctic_b0416 i arose obediently and went down the beach
PNV_arctic_b0192 outsiders are allowed five minute speeches the sick man urged
PNV_arctic_b0380 he had peeled off his shirt and was wildly waving it
PNV_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
PNV_arctic_a0519 such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land
PNV_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
PNV_arctic_b0509 he had fulfilled his duty and paid properly
PNV_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i'll go on seeing them forever
PNV_arctic_b0415 there was nothing for us but the wide raw ocean
PNV_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
PNV_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
PNV_arctic_b0342 each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up
PNV_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
PNV_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
PNV_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
PNV_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
PNV_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
PNV_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
PNV_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
PNV_arctic_a0225 i was brought up the way most girls in hawaii are brought up
PNV_arctic_b0320 the regret in his voice was provocative of a second burst of laughter
PNV_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
PNV_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
PNV_arctic_b0355 there was proper division of labor in the work they individually performed
PNV_arctic_a0459 there's too much of the schoolboy in me
PNV_arctic_a0102 he will follow us soon
PNV_arctic_a0271 now please give a plain statement of what occurred
PNV_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
PNV_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quietly as he had come
PNV_arctic_b0488 beyond refusing to sell us food they left us to ourselves
PNV_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
PNV_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
PNV_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
PNV_arctic_b0425 there were orange green gold green and a copper green
PNV_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
PNV_arctic_b0048 he looked like one who had passed through an uncomfortable hour or two
PNV_arctic_b0503 the scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land
PNV_arctic_b0165 he pulled and the log crashed down to break his back
PNV_arctic_b0304 his previous wives had never lived long enough to bear him children
PNV_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
PNV_arctic_b0393 i was still weak from my prolonged immersion
PNV_arctic_a0038 we'll have to watch our chances
PNV_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting
PNV_arctic_a0105 only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
PNV_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
PNV_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
PNV_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud 
PNV_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
PNV_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
PNV_arctic_a0178 every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated
PNV_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
PNV_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
PNV_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
PNV_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
PNV_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
PNV_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
PNV_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
PNV_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
PNV_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
PNV_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
PNV_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
PNV_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
PNV_arctic_a0375 the butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants
PNV_arctic_b0422 this was when the explosion occurred
PNV_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
PNV_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
HKK_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
HKK_arctic_a0475 his outstretched arm dropped to his side and he paused
HKK_arctic_b0386 my idea was that he would have more influence over the natives
HKK_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
HKK_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
HKK_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
HKK_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
HKK_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
HKK_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
HKK_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
HKK_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
HKK_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
HKK_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
HKK_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
HKK_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
HKK_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened
HKK_arctic_a0148 now these things had been struck dead within him
HKK_arctic_a0075 there has been a change she interrupted him
HKK_arctic_a0090 the singing voice approached rapidly
HKK_arctic_a0029 their forces were already moving into the north country
HKK_arctic_a0027 to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
HKK_arctic_a0018 there was a change now
HKK_arctic_a0378 that's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged
HKK_arctic_a0134 he obeyed the pressure of her hand
HKK_arctic_a0112 he was wounded in the arm
HKK_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
HKK_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
HKK_arctic_b0225 the president of the united states was his friend
HKK_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
HKK_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
HKK_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
HKK_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
HKK_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
HKK_arctic_b0106 for a full minute the two men stared into each other's face
HKK_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
HKK_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
HKK_arctic_b0238 the very thought of the effort to swim over was nauseating
HKK_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
HKK_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
HKK_arctic_b0469 very few people knew of the existence of this law
HKK_arctic_a0168 low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting
HKK_arctic_b0530 he had a big chimpanzee that was a winner
HKK_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
HKK_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
HKK_arctic_a0272 you can take a vacation on pay
HKK_arctic_a0416 the added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour
HKK_arctic_a0094 he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
HKK_arctic_b0019 his slim hands gripped the edges of the table
HKK_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
HKK_arctic_a0442 you live on an income which your father earned
HKK_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
HKK_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
HKK_arctic_a0139 he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
HKK_arctic_a0026 it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
HKK_arctic_a0041 meanwhile i'll go out to breathe a spell
HKK_arctic_a0099 a maddening joy pounded in his brain
HKK_arctic_a0108 he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
HKK_arctic_b0315 and this was their sole conversation throughout the meal
HKK_arctic_b0215 it is a good property and worth more than that
HKK_arctic_a0013 he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
HKK_arctic_a0104 she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
HKK_arctic_a0121 they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
HKK_arctic_a0054 there was nothing on the rock
HKK_arctic_a0303 but they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality
HKK_arctic_a0063 yes it was a man who asked a stranger
HKK_arctic_a0143 ah i had forgotten he exclaimed
HKK_arctic_a0209 it was not a large lake and almost round
HKK_arctic_b0518 but there was also talk of witchcraft in the village
HKK_arctic_a0364 we have plenty of capital ourselves and yet we want more
HKK_arctic_a0542 without a doubt some of them have dinner engagements
HKK_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
HKK_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
HKK_arctic_a0260 nobody knew his history they of the junta least of all
HKK_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
HKK_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
HKK_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
HKK_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
HKK_arctic_b0266 and now put yourself in my place for a moment
HKK_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
HKK_arctic_b0201 i also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in europe
HKK_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
HKK_arctic_b0192 outsiders are allowed five minute speeches the sick man urged
HKK_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
HKK_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
HKK_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i'll go on seeing them forever
HKK_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
HKK_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
HKK_arctic_b0342 each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up
HKK_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
HKK_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
HKK_arctic_b0143 it took him half an hour to reach the edge of it
HKK_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
HKK_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
HKK_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
HKK_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
HKK_arctic_a0369 in partnership with daylight the pair raided the san jose interurban
HKK_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
HKK_arctic_b0320 the regret in his voice was provocative of a second burst of laughter
HKK_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
HKK_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
HKK_arctic_b0355 there was proper division of labor in the work they individually performed
HKK_arctic_a0102 he will follow us soon
HKK_arctic_a0271 now please give a plain statement of what occurred
HKK_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
HKK_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quietly as he had come
HKK_arctic_a0365 these rumors may even originate with us
HKK_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
HKK_arctic_a0384 the farmer works the soil and produces grain
HKK_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
HKK_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
HKK_arctic_a0495 he bore no grudges and had few enemies
HKK_arctic_b0425 there were orange green gold green and a copper green
HKK_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
HKK_arctic_b0197 the planters are already considering the matter
HKK_arctic_b0068 only the chance sound had led him to observe them
HKK_arctic_b0503 the scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land
HKK_arctic_b0304 his previous wives had never lived long enough to bear him children
HKK_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
HKK_arctic_a0233 i never allow what can't be changed to annoy me
HKK_arctic_a0145 i have to be careful of them as they tear very easily
HKK_arctic_a0038 we'll have to watch our chances
HKK_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting
HKK_arctic_a0105 only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
HKK_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
HKK_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
HKK_arctic_a0144 but there was something even more startling than this resemblance
HKK_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud 
HKK_arctic_b0022 if i was out of the game it would be easily made
HKK_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
HKK_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
HKK_arctic_a0178 every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated
HKK_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
HKK_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
HKK_arctic_a0379 how old are you daddy
HKK_arctic_b0047 suppose you saw me at work through the window
HKK_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
HKK_arctic_a0258 soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays
HKK_arctic_a0345 she was trying to pass the apron string around him
HKK_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
HKK_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
HKK_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
HKK_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
HKK_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
HKK_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
HKK_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
HKK_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
HKK_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
HKK_arctic_a0375 the butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants
HKK_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
HKK_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
RRBI_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
RRBI_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
RRBI_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
RRBI_arctic_a0199 thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day
RRBI_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
RRBI_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
RRBI_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
RRBI_arctic_b0171 he changed his seat for a steamer reclining chair
RRBI_arctic_b0396 the pain from my hurt knee was agonizing
RRBI_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
RRBI_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
RRBI_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
RRBI_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
RRBI_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
RRBI_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
RRBI_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
RRBI_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened
RRBI_arctic_a0188 two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass
RRBI_arctic_b0002 you got out by fighting and i through a pretty girl
RRBI_arctic_b0317 he did not believe in the burning of daylight for such a luxury
RRBI_arctic_a0075 there has been a change she interrupted him
RRBI_arctic_a0090 the singing voice approached rapidly
RRBI_arctic_a0029 their forces were already moving into the north country
RRBI_arctic_a0027 to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
RRBI_arctic_a0018 there was a change now
RRBI_arctic_a0134 he obeyed the pressure of her hand
RRBI_arctic_a0191 for a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone
RRBI_arctic_a0112 he was wounded in the arm
RRBI_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
RRBI_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
RRBI_arctic_a0301 but all my dreams violated this law
RRBI_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
RRBI_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
RRBI_arctic_b0061 something about it seemed to fascinate him to challenge his presence
RRBI_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
RRBI_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
RRBI_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
RRBI_arctic_b0081 you were going to leave after you saw on me on the rock
RRBI_arctic_b0017 everything was working smoothly better than i had expected
RRBI_arctic_a0246 you have heard always how he was the lover of the princess naomi
RRBI_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
RRBI_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
RRBI_arctic_b0118 we saw your light and thought you wouldn't mind a call
RRBI_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
RRBI_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
RRBI_arctic_a0168 a low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting
RRBI_arctic_b0104 shooting pains passed like flashes of electricity through his body
RRBI_arctic_a0424 obviously it was a disease that could be contracted by contact
RRBI_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
RRBI_arctic_b0089 her beautiful hair was done up in shining coils
RRBI_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
RRBI_arctic_a0272 you can take a vacation on pay
RRBI_arctic_a0416 the added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour
RRBI_arctic_a0094 he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
RRBI_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
RRBI_arctic_b0433 we are cooking on the coal stove and on the oil burners
RRBI_arctic_b0136 swiftly his eyes measured the situation
RRBI_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
RRBI_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
RRBI_arctic_a0139 he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
RRBI_arctic_a0026 it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
RRBI_arctic_a0041 meanwhile i'll go out to breathe a spell
RRBI_arctic_a0099 a maddening joy pounded in his brain

RRBI_arctic_b0215 it is a good property and worth more than that
RRBI_arctic_a0013 he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
RRBI_arctic_a0104 she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
RRBI_arctic_a0121 they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
RRBI_arctic_a0411 it will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand
RRBI_arctic_a0054 there was nothing on the rock
RRBI_arctic_a0303 but they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality
RRBI_arctic_a0063 yes it was a man who asked a stranger
RRBI_arctic_a0214 besides he was paid one case of tobacco per head
RRBI_arctic_b0141 it was beating and waiting in the ambush of those black pits
RRBI_arctic_b0038 in her haste to get away she had forgotten these things
RRBI_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
RRBI_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
RRBI_arctic_b0158 she obeyed shrinking back with the baby in her arms
RRBI_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
RRBI_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
RRBI_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
RRBI_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
RRBI_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
RRBI_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
RRBI_arctic_a0255 you won't die of malnutrition be sure of that
RRBI_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
RRBI_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
RRBI_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i'll go on seeing them forever
RRBI_arctic_a0410 so we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well
RRBI_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
RRBI_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
RRBI_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
RRBI_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
RRBI_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
RRBI_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
RRBI_arctic_a0159 they look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life
RRBI_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
RRBI_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
RRBI_arctic_a0269 that's where they cut off the scottish chiefs and killed all hands
RRBI_arctic_b0160 it was over when he made his way through the ring of spectators
RRBI_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
RRBI_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
RRBI_arctic_b0073 with these arguments he convinced himself that he should go on alone
RRBI_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
RRBI_arctic_a0102 he will follow us soon
RRBI_arctic_a0282 if you mean to insinuate brentwood began hotly
RRBI_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
RRBI_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quietly as he had come
RRBI_arctic_a0292 here in the midmorning the first casualty occurred
RRBI_arctic_a0365 these rumors may even originate with us
RRBI_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
RRBI_arctic_a0384 the farmer works the soil and produces grain
RRBI_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
RRBI_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
RRBI_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
RRBI_arctic_b0197 the planters are already considering the matter
RRBI_arctic_a0266 they handled two men already both grub thieves
RRBI_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
RRBI_arctic_a0038 we will have to watch our chances
RRBI_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting
RRBI_arctic_a0105 only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
RRBI_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
RRBI_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
RRBI_arctic_a0208 youth had come back to her freed from the yoke of oppression
RRBI_arctic_a0144 but there was something even more startling than his resemblance
RRBI_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud
RRBI_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
RRBI_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
RRBI_arctic_a0178 every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated
RRBI_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
RRBI_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
RRBI_arctic_b0047 suppose you saw me at work through the window
RRBI_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
RRBI_arctic_b0057 they have won popular sentiment through the newspapers
RRBI_arctic_a0405 it seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work
RRBI_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
RRBI_arctic_b0371 yield yourself to the waters that are ripping and tearing at you
RRBI_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
RRBI_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
RRBI_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
RRBI_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
RRBI_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
RRBI_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
RRBI_arctic_b0411 he gave no reason but his motive was obvious enough
RRBI_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
RRBI_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
RRBI_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
RRBI_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
RRBI_arctic_b0321 instead he arrived on the night of the second day
