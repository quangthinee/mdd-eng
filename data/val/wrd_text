THV_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
THV_arctic_b0189 that is what distinguishes all of us from the lower animals
THV_arctic_a0475 his outstretched arm dropped to his side and he paused
THV_arctic_b0386 my idea was that he would have more influence over the natives
THV_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
THV_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
THV_arctic_b0288 we would not spend another such night
THV_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
THV_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
THV_arctic_a0515 but here amongst ourselves let us speak out
THV_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
THV_arctic_b0465 but such divergence of opinion would constitute no menace to society
THV_arctic_b0251 they must have been swept away by the chaotic currents
THV_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
THV_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
THV_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
THV_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
THV_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
THV_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
THV_arctic_b0527 the very idea of it was preposterous
THV_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
THV_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened
THV_arctic_b0481 the task we set ourselves was threefold
THV_arctic_a0075 there has been a change she interrupted him
THV_arctic_a0090 the singing voice approached rapidly
THV_arctic_a0029 their forces were already moving into the north country
THV_arctic_a0027 to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
THV_arctic_a0018 there was a change now
THV_arctic_a0378 that's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged
THV_arctic_a0134 he obeyed the pressure of her hand
THV_arctic_a0434 a half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds
THV_arctic_a0112 he was wounded in the arm
THV_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
THV_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
THV_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
THV_arctic_b0075 in that case he could not miss them if he used caution
THV_arctic_b0074 yet behind them there was another and more powerful motive
THV_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
THV_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
THV_arctic_b0323 crickets began to chirp and more geese and ducks flew overhead
THV_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
THV_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
THV_arctic_b0358 the temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip
THV_arctic_b0140 they edged nearer and stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world
THV_arctic_b0106 for a full minute the two men stared into each other's face
THV_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
THV_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
THV_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
THV_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
THV_arctic_b0469 very few people knew of the existence of this law
THV_arctic_a0168 a low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting
THV_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
THV_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
THV_arctic_b0534 i'll tell you the librarian said with a brightening face
THV_arctic_a0094 he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
THV_arctic_b0019 his slim hands gripped the edges of the table
THV_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
THV_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
THV_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
THV_arctic_a0139 he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
THV_arctic_a0026 it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
THV_arctic_a0041 meanwhile i'll go out to breathe a spell
THV_arctic_a0099 a maddening joy pounded in his brain
THV_arctic_a0108 he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
THV_arctic_b0315 and this was their sole conversation throughout the meal
THV_arctic_a0013 he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
THV_arctic_a0104 she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
THV_arctic_a0121 they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
THV_arctic_a0054 there was nothing on the rock
THV_arctic_a0063 yes it was a man who asked a stranger
THV_arctic_a0209 it was not a large lake and almost round
THV_arctic_b0518 but there was also talk of witchcraft in the village
THV_arctic_a0364 we have plenty of capital ourselves and yet we want more
THV_arctic_a0542 without a doubt some of them have dinner engagements
THV_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
THV_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
THV_arctic_a0260 nobody knew his history they of the junta least of all
THV_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
THV_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
THV_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
THV_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
THV_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
THV_arctic_b0201 i also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in europe
THV_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
THV_arctic_b0416 i arose obediently and went down the beach
THV_arctic_b0192 outsiders are allowed five minute speeches the sick man urged
THV_arctic_b0380 he had peeled off his shirt and was wildly waving it
THV_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
THV_arctic_a0519 such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land
THV_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
THV_arctic_b0509 he had fulfilled his duty and paid properly
THV_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i'll go on seeing them forever
THV_arctic_b0415 there was nothing for us but the wide raw ocean
THV_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
THV_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
THV_arctic_b0342 each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up
THV_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
THV_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
THV_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
THV_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
THV_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
THV_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
THV_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
THV_arctic_a0225 i was brought up the way most girls in hawaii are brought up
THV_arctic_b0320 the regret in his voice was provocative of a second burst of laughter
THV_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
THV_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
THV_arctic_b0355 there was proper division of labor in the work they individually performed
THV_arctic_a0459 there's too much of the schoolboy in me
THV_arctic_a0102 he will follow us soon
THV_arctic_a0271 now please give a plain statement of what occurred
THV_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
THV_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quietly as he had come
THV_arctic_b0488 beyond refusing to sell us food they left us to ourselves
THV_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
THV_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
THV_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
THV_arctic_b0425 there were orange green gold green and a copper green
THV_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
THV_arctic_b0048 he looked like one who had passed through an uncomfortable hour or two
THV_arctic_b0503 the scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land
THV_arctic_b0165 he pulled and the log crashed down to break his back
THV_arctic_b0304 his previous wives had never lived long enough to bear him children
THV_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
THV_arctic_b0393 i was still weak from my prolonged immersion
THV_arctic_a0038 we'll have to watch our chances
THV_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting
THV_arctic_a0105 only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
THV_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
THV_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
THV_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud 
THV_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
THV_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
THV_arctic_a0178 every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated
THV_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
THV_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
THV_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
THV_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
THV_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
THV_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
THV_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
THV_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
THV_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
THV_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
THV_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
THV_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
THV_arctic_a0375 the butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants
THV_arctic_b0422 this was when the explosion occurred
THV_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
THV_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
SVBI_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
SVBI_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
SVBI_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
SVBI_arctic_a0199 thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day
SVBI_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
SVBI_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
SVBI_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
SVBI_arctic_b0171 he changed his seat for a steamer reclining chair
SVBI_arctic_b0396 the pain from my hurt knee was agonizing
SVBI_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
SVBI_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
SVBI_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
SVBI_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
SVBI_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
SVBI_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
SVBI_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
SVBI_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened
SVBI_arctic_a0188 two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass
SVBI_arctic_b0002 you got out by fighting and i through a pretty girl
SVBI_arctic_b0317 he did not believe in the burning of daylight for such a luxury
SVBI_arctic_a0075 there has been a change she interrupted him
SVBI_arctic_a0090 the singing voice approached rapidly
SVBI_arctic_a0029 their forces were already moving into the north country
SVBI_arctic_a0027 to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
SVBI_arctic_a0018 there was a change now
SVBI_arctic_a0134 he obeyed the pressure of her hand
SVBI_arctic_a0191 for a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone
SVBI_arctic_a0112 he was wounded in the arm
SVBI_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
SVBI_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
SVBI_arctic_a0301 but all my dreams violated this law
SVBI_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
SVBI_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
SVBI_arctic_b0061 something about it seemed to fascinate him to challenge his presence
SVBI_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
SVBI_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
SVBI_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
SVBI_arctic_b0081 you were going to leave after you saw me on the rock
SVBI_arctic_b0017 everything was working smoothly better than i had expected
SVBI_arctic_a0246 you have heard always how he was the lover of the princess naomi
SVBI_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
SVBI_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
SVBI_arctic_b0118 we saw your light and thought you wouldn't mind a call
SVBI_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
SVBI_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
SVBI_arctic_a0168 low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting
SVBI_arctic_b0104 shooting pains passed like flashes of electricity through his body
SVBI_arctic_a0424 obviously it was a disease that could be contracted by contact
SVBI_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
SVBI_arctic_b0089 her beautiful hair was done up in shining coils
SVBI_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
SVBI_arctic_a0272 you can take a vacation on pay
SVBI_arctic_a0416 the added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour
SVBI_arctic_a0094 he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
SVBI_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
SVBI_arctic_b0433 we are cooking on the coal stove and on the oil burners
SVBI_arctic_b0136 swiftly his eyes measured the situation
SVBI_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
SVBI_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
SVBI_arctic_a0139 he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
SVBI_arctic_a0026 it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
SVBI_arctic_a0041 meanwhile i'll go out to breathe a spell
SVBI_arctic_a0099 a maddening joy pounded in his brain
SVBI_arctic_a0108 he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
SVBI_arctic_b0315 and this was their sole conversation throughout the meal
SVBI_arctic_b0215 it is a good property and worth more than that
SVBI_arctic_a0013 he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
SVBI_arctic_a0104 she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
SVBI_arctic_a0121 they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
SVBI_arctic_a0411 it will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand
SVBI_arctic_a0054 there was nothing on the rock
SVBI_arctic_a0303 but they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality
SVBI_arctic_a0063 yes it was a man who asked a stranger
SVBI_arctic_a0214 besides he was paid one case of tobacco per head
SVBI_arctic_b0141 it was beating and waiting in the ambush of those black pits
SVBI_arctic_b0038 in her haste to get away she had forgotten these things
SVBI_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
SVBI_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
SVBI_arctic_b0158 she obeyed shrinking back with the baby in her arms
SVBI_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
SVBI_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
SVBI_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
SVBI_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
SVBI_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
SVBI_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
SVBI_arctic_a0255 you won't die of malnutrition be sure of that
SVBI_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
SVBI_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
SVBI_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i'll go on seeing them forever
SVBI_arctic_a0410 so we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well
SVBI_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
SVBI_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
SVBI_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
SVBI_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
SVBI_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
SVBI_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
SVBI_arctic_a0159 they look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life
SVBI_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
SVBI_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
SVBI_arctic_a0269 that's where they cut off the scottish chiefs and killed all hands
SVBI_arctic_b0160 it was over when he made his way through the ring of spectators
SVBI_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
SVBI_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
SVBI_arctic_b0073 with these arguments he convinced himself that he should go on alone
SVBI_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
SVBI_arctic_a0102 he will follow us soon
SVBI_arctic_a0282 if you mean to insinuate brentwood began hotly
SVBI_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
SVBI_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quietly as he had come
SVBI_arctic_a0292 here in the midmorning the first casualty occurred
SVBI_arctic_a0365 these rumors may even originate with us
SVBI_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
SVBI_arctic_a0384 the farmer works the soil and produces grain
SVBI_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
SVBI_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
SVBI_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
SVBI_arctic_b0197 the planters are already considering the matter
SVBI_arctic_a0266 they handled two men already both grub thieves
SVBI_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
SVBI_arctic_a0038 we'll have to watch our chances
SVBI_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting
SVBI_arctic_a0105 only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
SVBI_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
SVBI_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
SVBI_arctic_a0208 youth had come back to her freed from the yoke of oppression
SVBI_arctic_a0144 but there was something even more startling than this resemblance
SVBI_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud 
SVBI_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
SVBI_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
SVBI_arctic_a0178 every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated
SVBI_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
SVBI_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
SVBI_arctic_b0047 suppose you saw me at work through the window
SVBI_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
SVBI_arctic_b0057 they have won popular sentiment through the newspapers
SVBI_arctic_a0405 it seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work
SVBI_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
SVBI_arctic_b0371 yield yourself to the waters that are ripping and tearing at you
SVBI_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
SVBI_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
SVBI_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
SVBI_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
SVBI_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
SVBI_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
SVBI_arctic_b0411 he gave no reason but his motive was obvious enough
SVBI_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
SVBI_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
SVBI_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
SVBI_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
SVBI_arctic_b0321 instead he arrived on the night of the second day
MBMPS_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
MBMPS_arctic_a0299 i tell you i am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot
MBMPS_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
MBMPS_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
MBMPS_arctic_b0070 there was no chance to fire without hitting him
MBMPS_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
MBMPS_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
MBMPS_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
MBMPS_arctic_a0227 it was the same way with our revolvers and rifles
MBMPS_arctic_b0150 and he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear
MBMPS_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
MBMPS_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
MBMPS_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
MBMPS_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
MBMPS_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
MBMPS_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
MBMPS_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
MBMPS_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened
MBMPS_arctic_a0148 now these things had been struck dead within him
MBMPS_arctic_a0075 there has been a change she interrupted him
MBMPS_arctic_a0090 the singing voice approached rapidly
MBMPS_arctic_a0029 their forces were already moving into the north country
MBMPS_arctic_a0027 to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
MBMPS_arctic_a0018 there was a change now
MBMPS_arctic_a0134 he obeyed the pressure of her hand
MBMPS_arctic_a0191 for a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone
MBMPS_arctic_a0112 he was wounded in the arm
MBMPS_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
MBMPS_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
MBMPS_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
MBMPS_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
MBMPS_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
MBMPS_arctic_a0176 for the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap
MBMPS_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
MBMPS_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
MBMPS_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
MBMPS_arctic_b0279 he gave one last snarl and slid from view among the trees
MBMPS_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
MBMPS_arctic_a0295 and twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows
MBMPS_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
MBMPS_arctic_a0500 who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury
MBMPS_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
MBMPS_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
MBMPS_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
MBMPS_arctic_b0534 i'll tell you the librarian said with a brightening face
MBMPS_arctic_a0401 the man smiled grimly and brought a hatchet and a club
MBMPS_arctic_a0416 the added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour
MBMPS_arctic_a0094 he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
MBMPS_arctic_a0548 also churches and preachers i had never known
MBMPS_arctic_b0019 his slim hands gripped the edges of the table
MBMPS_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
MBMPS_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
MBMPS_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
MBMPS_arctic_a0139 he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
MBMPS_arctic_a0026 it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
MBMPS_arctic_b0042 ten minutes had not elapsed since he had dropped the handkerchief
MBMPS_arctic_b0298 his hand shot out and clutched crooked leg by the neck
MBMPS_arctic_b0187 her achievements with cocoanuts were a revelation
MBMPS_arctic_a0041 meanwhile i'll go out to breathe a spell
MBMPS_arctic_a0099 a maddening joy pounded in his brain
MBMPS_arctic_a0185 the questions may have come vaguely in his mind
MBMPS_arctic_a0108 he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
MBMPS_arctic_a0013 he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
MBMPS_arctic_a0104 she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
MBMPS_arctic_a0121 they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
MBMPS_arctic_a0054 there was nothing on the rock
MBMPS_arctic_a0303 but they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality
MBMPS_arctic_a0063 yes it was a man who asked a stranger
MBMPS_arctic_a0265 the discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment
MBMPS_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
MBMPS_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
MBMPS_arctic_a0556 why he's bought forty pounds of goods from you already
MBMPS_arctic_a0260 nobody knew his history they of the junta least of all
MBMPS_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
MBMPS_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
MBMPS_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
MBMPS_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
MBMPS_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
MBMPS_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
MBMPS_arctic_b0269 why not like any railroad station or ferry depot
MBMPS_arctic_b0413 he may desire to escape pain or to enjoy pleasure
MBMPS_arctic_b0494 never so strange a prophet came up to jerusalem
MBMPS_arctic_b0434 the steward has just tendered me a respectful bit of advice
MBMPS_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
MBMPS_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
MBMPS_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i'll go on seeing them forever
MBMPS_arctic_a0210 its diameter was not more than two hundred yards
MBMPS_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
MBMPS_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
MBMPS_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
MBMPS_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
MBMPS_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
MBMPS_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
MBMPS_arctic_a0159 they look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life
MBMPS_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
MBMPS_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
MBMPS_arctic_a0269 that's where they cut off the scottish chiefs and killed all hands
MBMPS_arctic_a0369 in partnership with daylight the pair raided the san jose interurban
MBMPS_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
MBMPS_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
MBMPS_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
MBMPS_arctic_a0102 he will follow us soon
MBMPS_arctic_a0198 sometimes her dreams were filled with visions
MBMPS_arctic_a0271 now please give a plain statement of what occurred
MBMPS_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
MBMPS_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quietly as he had come
MBMPS_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
MBMPS_arctic_a0154 he was smooth shaven and his hair and eyes were black
MBMPS_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
MBMPS_arctic_a0300 from my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror
MBMPS_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
MBMPS_arctic_a0212 fresh cases still able to walk they clustered about the spokesman
MBMPS_arctic_a0363 it is not an attempt to smash the market
MBMPS_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
MBMPS_arctic_b0503 the scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land
MBMPS_arctic_b0304 his previous wives had never lived long enough to bear him children
MBMPS_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
MBMPS_arctic_a0233 i never allow what can't be changed to annoy me
MBMPS_arctic_a0145 i have to be careful of them as they tear very easily
MBMPS_arctic_a0038 we'll have to watch our chances
MBMPS_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting
MBMPS_arctic_a0105 only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
MBMPS_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
MBMPS_arctic_a0441 violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me
MBMPS_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
MBMPS_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud 
MBMPS_arctic_a0298 this tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave saxon a little joy thrill
MBMPS_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
MBMPS_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
MBMPS_arctic_a0178 every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated
MBMPS_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
MBMPS_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
MBMPS_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
MBMPS_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
MBMPS_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
MBMPS_arctic_b0538 at the best they were necessary accessories
MBMPS_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
MBMPS_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
MBMPS_arctic_a0254 straight out they swam their heads growing smaller and smaller
MBMPS_arctic_a0487 the river bared its bosom and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness
MBMPS_arctic_b0461 by virtue of that power we shall remain in power
MBMPS_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
MBMPS_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
MBMPS_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
MBMPS_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
MBMPS_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
MBMPS_arctic_a0170 there was none of the joy of meeting in his face
MBMPS_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
MBMPS_arctic_a0320 with my strength i slammed it full into red eye's face
MBMPS_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
NCC_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
NCC_arctic_b0189 that is what distinguishes all of us from the lower animals
NCC_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
NCC_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
NCC_arctic_b0288 we would not spend another such night
NCC_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
NCC_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
NCC_arctic_a0515 but here amongst ourselves let us speak out
NCC_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
NCC_arctic_b0531 i'm sure it must have been some adventure
NCC_arctic_b0465 but such divergence of opinion would constitute no menace to society
NCC_arctic_b0479 violation of this law was made a high misdemeanor and punished accordingly
NCC_arctic_b0251 they must have been swept away by the chaotic currents
NCC_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
NCC_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
NCC_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
NCC_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
NCC_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
NCC_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
NCC_arctic_b0527 very idea of it was preposterous
NCC_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
NCC_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened
NCC_arctic_a0549 do you know that we weigh every pound of coal we burn
NCC_arctic_b0481 the task we set ourselves was threefold
NCC_arctic_a0075 there has been a change she interrupted him
NCC_arctic_a0090 the singing voice approached rapidly
NCC_arctic_a0029 their forces were already moving into the north country
NCC_arctic_a0027 to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
NCC_arctic_a0018 there was a change now
NCC_arctic_a0536 he would destroy all things that are fixed
NCC_arctic_a0134 he obeyed the pressure of her hand
NCC_arctic_b0026 you have associated with some of these men
NCC_arctic_a0434 a half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds
NCC_arctic_a0112 he was wounded in the arm
NCC_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
NCC_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
NCC_arctic_a0576 and the big persian knew of his existence before he did of hers
NCC_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
NCC_arctic_b0075 in that case he could not miss them if he used caution
NCC_arctic_b0074 yet behind them there was another and more powerful motive
NCC_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
NCC_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
NCC_arctic_b0323 crickets began to chirp and more geese and ducks flew overhead
NCC_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
NCC_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
NCC_arctic_b0358 the temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip
NCC_arctic_b0140 they edged nearer and stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world
NCC_arctic_b0385 last night he showed all the symptoms of coming down with pneumonia
NCC_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
NCC_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
NCC_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
NCC_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
NCC_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
NCC_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
NCC_arctic_b0004 when i can't see beauty in woman i want to die
NCC_arctic_b0282 some of the smaller veins had doubtless been ruptured
NCC_arctic_a0094 he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
NCC_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
NCC_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
NCC_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
NCC_arctic_a0139 he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
NCC_arctic_a0026 it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
NCC_arctic_a0041 meanwhile i'll go out to breathe a spell
NCC_arctic_a0099 a maddening joy pounded in his brain
NCC_arctic_a0108 he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
NCC_arctic_a0013 he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
NCC_arctic_a0571 he had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out
NCC_arctic_b0483 the flower of the artistic and intellectual world were revolutionists
NCC_arctic_a0104 she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
NCC_arctic_a0121 they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
NCC_arctic_a0054 there was nothing on the rock
NCC_arctic_a0063 yes it was a man who asked a stranger
NCC_arctic_a0245 out of his eighteen hundred he laid aside sixteen hundred each year
NCC_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
NCC_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
NCC_arctic_a0335 red eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down
NCC_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
NCC_arctic_b0418 at that moment i got the impression that she was willowy
NCC_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
NCC_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
NCC_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
NCC_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
NCC_arctic_b0142 something vastly more thrilling had come into it now
NCC_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
NCC_arctic_b0416 i arose obediently and went down the beach
NCC_arctic_a0575 there weren't any missions and he was the man to know
NCC_arctic_b0380 he had peeled off his shirt and was wildly waving it
NCC_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
NCC_arctic_a0519 such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land
NCC_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
NCC_arctic_b0509 he had fulfilled his duty and paid properly
NCC_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i'll go on seeing them forever
NCC_arctic_b0185 your being wrecked here has been a godsend to me
NCC_arctic_b0415 there was nothing for us but the wide raw ocean
NCC_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
NCC_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
NCC_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
NCC_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
NCC_arctic_b0430 they are babbling and chattering all together
NCC_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
NCC_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
NCC_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
NCC_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
NCC_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
NCC_arctic_a0225 i was brought up the way most girls in hawaii are brought up
NCC_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
NCC_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
NCC_arctic_a0459 there's too much of the schoolboy in me
NCC_arctic_a0102 he will follow us soon
NCC_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
NCC_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quietly as he had come
NCC_arctic_b0488 beyond refusing to sell us food they left us to ourselves
NCC_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
NCC_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
NCC_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
NCC_arctic_b0476 the reorganization of these countries took the form of revolution
NCC_arctic_b0456 he was an amphibian and a mountaineer
NCC_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
NCC_arctic_b0048 he looked like one who had passed through an uncomfortable hour or two
NCC_arctic_b0165 he pulled and the log crashed down to break his back
NCC_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
NCC_arctic_b0393 i was still weak from my prolonged immersion
NCC_arctic_a0038 we'll have to watch our chances
NCC_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting
NCC_arctic_a0105 only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
NCC_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
NCC_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
NCC_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud 
NCC_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
NCC_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
NCC_arctic_b0400 how could i answer the question on the spur of the moment
NCC_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
NCC_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
NCC_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
NCC_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
NCC_arctic_b0366 i forgot how easily i had taught myself from the printed page
NCC_arctic_b0402 an altruistic act is an act performed for the welfare of others
NCC_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
NCC_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
NCC_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
NCC_arctic_b0461 by virtue of that power we shall remain in power
NCC_arctic_b0203 a month in australia would finish me
NCC_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
NCC_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
NCC_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
NCC_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
NCC_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
NCC_arctic_b0422 this was when the explosion occurred
NCC_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
NCC_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
YDCK_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
YDCK_arctic_a0475 his outstretched arm dropped to his side and he paused
YDCK_arctic_b0386 my idea was that he would have more influence over the natives
YDCK_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
YDCK_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
YDCK_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
YDCK_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
YDCK_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
YDCK_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
YDCK_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
YDCK_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
YDCK_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
YDCK_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
YDCK_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
YDCK_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
YDCK_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened
YDCK_arctic_a0148 now these things had been struck dead within him
YDCK_arctic_a0075 there has been a change she interrupted him
YDCK_arctic_a0090 the singing voice approached rapidly
YDCK_arctic_a0029 their forces were already moving into the north country
YDCK_arctic_a0027 to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
YDCK_arctic_a0018 there was a change now
YDCK_arctic_a0378 that's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged
YDCK_arctic_a0134 he obeyed the pressure of her hand
YDCK_arctic_a0112 he was wounded in the arm
YDCK_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
YDCK_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
YDCK_arctic_b0225 the president of the united states was his friend
YDCK_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
YDCK_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
YDCK_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
YDCK_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
YDCK_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
YDCK_arctic_b0106 for a full minute the two men stared into each other's face
YDCK_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
YDCK_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
YDCK_arctic_b0238 the very thought of the effort to swim over was nauseating
YDCK_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
YDCK_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
YDCK_arctic_b0469 very few people knew of the existence of this law
YDCK_arctic_a0168 a low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting
YDCK_arctic_b0530 he had a big chimpanzee that was a winner
YDCK_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
YDCK_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
YDCK_arctic_a0416 the added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour
YDCK_arctic_a0094 he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
YDCK_arctic_b0019 his slim hands gripped the edges of the table
YDCK_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
YDCK_arctic_a0442 you live on an income which your father earned
YDCK_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
YDCK_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
YDCK_arctic_a0139 he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
YDCK_arctic_a0026 it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
YDCK_arctic_a0041 meanwhile i will go out to breathe a spell
YDCK_arctic_a0099 a maddening joy pounded in his brain
YDCK_arctic_a0108 he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
YDCK_arctic_b0315 and this was their sole conversation throughout the meal
YDCK_arctic_b0215 it is a good property and worth more than that
YDCK_arctic_a0013 he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
YDCK_arctic_a0104 she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
YDCK_arctic_a0121 they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
YDCK_arctic_a0054 there was nothing on the rock
YDCK_arctic_a0303 but they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality
YDCK_arctic_a0063 yes it was a man who asked a stranger
YDCK_arctic_a0143 ah i had forgotten he exclaimed
YDCK_arctic_b0518 but there was also talk of witchcraft in the village
YDCK_arctic_a0364 we have plenty of capital ourselves and yet we want more
YDCK_arctic_a0542 without a doubt some of them have dinner engagements
YDCK_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
YDCK_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
YDCK_arctic_a0260 nobody knew his history they of the junta least of all
YDCK_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
YDCK_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
YDCK_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
YDCK_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
YDCK_arctic_b0266 and now put yourself in my place for a moment
YDCK_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
YDCK_arctic_b0201 i also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in europe
YDCK_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
YDCK_arctic_b0192 outsiders are allowed five minute speeches the sick man urged
YDCK_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
YDCK_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
YDCK_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i'll go on seeing them forever
YDCK_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
YDCK_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
YDCK_arctic_b0342 each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up
YDCK_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
YDCK_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
YDCK_arctic_b0143 it took him half an hour to reach the edge of it
YDCK_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
YDCK_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
YDCK_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
YDCK_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
YDCK_arctic_a0369 in partnership with daylight the pair raided the san jose interurban
YDCK_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
YDCK_arctic_b0320 the regret in his voice was provocative of a second burst of laughter
YDCK_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
YDCK_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
YDCK_arctic_b0355 there was proper division of labor in the work they individually performed
YDCK_arctic_a0102 he will follow us soon
YDCK_arctic_a0271 now please give a plain statement of what occurred
YDCK_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
YDCK_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quietly as he had come
YDCK_arctic_a0365 these rumors may even originate with us
YDCK_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
YDCK_arctic_a0384 the farmer works the soil and produces grain
YDCK_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
YDCK_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
YDCK_arctic_a0495 he bore no grudges and had few enemies
YDCK_arctic_b0425 there were orange green gold green and a copper green
YDCK_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
YDCK_arctic_b0197 the planters are already considering the matter
YDCK_arctic_b0068 only the chance sound had led him to observe them
YDCK_arctic_b0503 the scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land
YDCK_arctic_b0304 his previous wives had never lived long enough to bear him children
YDCK_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
YDCK_arctic_a0233 i never allow what can't be changed to annoy me
YDCK_arctic_a0145 i have to be careful of them as they tear very easily
YDCK_arctic_a0038 we will have to watch our chances
YDCK_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting
YDCK_arctic_a0105 only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
YDCK_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
YDCK_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
YDCK_arctic_a0144 but there was something even more startling than this resemblance
YDCK_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud 
YDCK_arctic_b0022 if i was out of the game it would be easily made
YDCK_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
YDCK_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
YDCK_arctic_a0178 every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated
YDCK_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
YDCK_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
YDCK_arctic_a0379 how old are you daddy
YDCK_arctic_b0047 suppose you saw me at work through the window
YDCK_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
YDCK_arctic_a0258 soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays
YDCK_arctic_a0345 she was trying to pass the apron string around him
YDCK_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
YDCK_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
YDCK_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
YDCK_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
YDCK_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
YDCK_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
YDCK_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
YDCK_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
YDCK_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
YDCK_arctic_a0375 the butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants
YDCK_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
YDCK_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
YBAA_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
YBAA_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
YBAA_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
YBAA_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
YBAA_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
YBAA_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
YBAA_arctic_b0150 and he has filled with a strange and foreboding fear
YBAA_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
YBAA_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
YBAA_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
YBAA_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
YBAA_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
YBAA_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
YBAA_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
YBAA_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened
YBAA_arctic_a0075 there has been a change she interrupted him
YBAA_arctic_a0090 the singing voice approached rapidly
YBAA_arctic_a0029 their forces were already moving into the north country
YBAA_arctic_a0027 to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
YBAA_arctic_a0018 there was a change now
YBAA_arctic_a0134 he obeyed the pressure of her hand
YBAA_arctic_a0112 he was wounded in the arm
YBAA_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
YBAA_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
YBAA_arctic_b0455 his reward should have been peace and repose
YBAA_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
YBAA_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
YBAA_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
YBAA_arctic_b0444 he did not know what went on in the minds of his superiors
YBAA_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
YBAA_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
YBAA_arctic_b0106 for a full minute the two men stared into each other's face
YBAA_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
YBAA_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
YBAA_arctic_b0103 he lifted his eyes and a strange cry burst from his lips
YBAA_arctic_b0340 these quick little joys of hers were sources of joy to him
YBAA_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
YBAA_arctic_a0500 who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury
YBAA_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
YBAA_arctic_b0469 very few people knew of the existence of this law
YBAA_arctic_a0529 as i say he had tapped the message very rapidly
YBAA_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
YBAA_arctic_b0016 he chuckled as he pulled out his pipe and began filling it
YBAA_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
YBAA_arctic_b0534 i'll tell you the librarian said with a brightening face
YBAA_arctic_b0490 what an excited whispering and conferring took place
YBAA_arctic_a0548 also churches and preachers i had never known
YBAA_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
YBAA_arctic_a0461 ah we were very close together in that moment
YBAA_arctic_b0433 we are cooking on the coal stove and on the oil burners
YBAA_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
YBAA_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
YBAA_arctic_a0139 he told himself that he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
YBAA_arctic_a0026 it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
YBAA_arctic_a0041 meanwhile i'll go out to breathe a spell
YBAA_arctic_a0099 a maddening joy pounded in his brain
YBAA_arctic_b0307 we got few vegetables and fruits and became fish eaters
YBAA_arctic_a0108 he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
YBAA_arctic_a0013 he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
YBAA_arctic_a0104 she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
YBAA_arctic_a0121 they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
YBAA_arctic_a0054 there was nothing on the rock
YBAA_arctic_a0063 yes it was a man who asked a stranger
YBAA_arctic_a0214 besides he was paid one case of tobacco per head
YBAA_arctic_b0518 but there was also talk of witchcraft in the village
YBAA_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
YBAA_arctic_a0501 you're joking me sir the other managed to articulate
YBAA_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
YBAA_arctic_b0158 she obeyed shrinking back with the baby in her arms
YBAA_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
YBAA_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
YBAA_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
YBAA_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
YBAA_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
YBAA_arctic_b0504 the life there was healthful and athletic but too juvenile
YBAA_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
YBAA_arctic_b0367 any average young fellow can teach himself in a week
YBAA_arctic_b0413 he may desire to escape pain or to enjoy pleasure
YBAA_arctic_b0494 never so strange a prophet came up to jerusalem
YBAA_arctic_b0495 we who have endured so much surely can endure a little more
YBAA_arctic_b0434 the steward has just tendered me a respectful bit of advice
YBAA_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
YBAA_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
YBAA_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i'll go on seeing them forever
YBAA_arctic_b0438 they ran the canoe in and climbed the high earth bank
YBAA_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
YBAA_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
YBAA_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
YBAA_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
YBAA_arctic_a0257 they are coming ashore whoever they are
YBAA_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
YBAA_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
YBAA_arctic_a0159 they look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life
YBAA_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
YBAA_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
YBAA_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
YBAA_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
YBAA_arctic_b0146 after all it was simply a mistake in judgment
YBAA_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
YBAA_arctic_a0102 he will follow us soon
YBAA_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
YBAA_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quietly as he had come
YBAA_arctic_b0452 they saw each other for the first time in boston
YBAA_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
YBAA_arctic_b0324 not till the twentieth of may did the river break
YBAA_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
YBAA_arctic_a0300 from my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror
YBAA_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
YBAA_arctic_b0425 there were orange green gold green and a copper green
YBAA_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
YBAA_arctic_b0126 blood was oozing slowly from the wounded man's right breast
YBAA_arctic_b0424 it is a very tenable hypothesis and will bear looking into
YBAA_arctic_b0068 only the chance sound had led him to observe them
YBAA_arctic_b0503 the scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land
YBAA_arctic_b0432 he is a candidate rising from the serf class to our class
YBAA_arctic_b0492 thus he turned the tenets and jargons of psychology back on me
YBAA_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
YBAA_arctic_a0038 we'll have to watch our chances
YBAA_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting
YBAA_arctic_a0105 only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
YBAA_arctic_b0348 would you be satisfied with that one hundredth part of me
YBAA_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
YBAA_arctic_a0426 they don't know the length of time of incubation
YBAA_arctic_a0441 violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me
YBAA_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
YBAA_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud 
YBAA_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
YBAA_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
YBAA_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
YBAA_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
YBAA_arctic_a0379 how old are you daddy
YBAA_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
YBAA_arctic_b0428 the history of our westward faring race is written in it
YBAA_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
YBAA_arctic_b0310 a little treatment massage with some help from the doctor
YBAA_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
YBAA_arctic_b0538 at the best they were necessary accessories
YBAA_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
YBAA_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
YBAA_arctic_b0461 by virtue of that power we shall remain in power
YBAA_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
YBAA_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
YBAA_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
YBAA_arctic_b0083 in it there was something that was almost tragedy
YBAA_arctic_b0506 it would help to tide me along until i got steady employment
YBAA_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
YBAA_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
YBAA_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like of a chinese debutante
YBAA_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
