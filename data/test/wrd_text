NJS_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
NJS_arctic_a0299 i tell you i'm disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot
NJS_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
NJS_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
NJS_arctic_b0070 there was no chance to fire without hitting him
NJS_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
NJS_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
NJS_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
NJS_arctic_a0227 it was the same way with our revolvers and rifles
NJS_arctic_b0150 and he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear
NJS_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
NJS_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
NJS_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
NJS_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
NJS_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
NJS_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
NJS_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
NJS_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened
NJS_arctic_a0148 now these things had been struck dead within him
NJS_arctic_a0075 there has been a change she interrupted him
NJS_arctic_a0090 the singing voice approached rapidly
NJS_arctic_a0029 their forces were already moving into the north country
NJS_arctic_a0027 to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
NJS_arctic_a0018 there was a change now
NJS_arctic_a0134 he obeyed the pressure of her hand
NJS_arctic_a0191 for a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone
NJS_arctic_a0112 he was wounded in the arm
NJS_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
NJS_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
NJS_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
NJS_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
NJS_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
NJS_arctic_a0176 for the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap
NJS_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
NJS_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
NJS_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
NJS_arctic_b0279 he gave one last snarl and slid from view among the trees
NJS_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
NJS_arctic_a0295 and twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows
NJS_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
NJS_arctic_a0500 who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury
NJS_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
NJS_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
NJS_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
NJS_arctic_b0534 i'll tell you the librarian said with a brightening face
NJS_arctic_a0401 the man smiled grimly and brought a hatchet and a club
NJS_arctic_a0416 the added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour
NJS_arctic_a0094 he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
NJS_arctic_a0548 also churches and preachers i had never known
NJS_arctic_b0019 his slim hands gripped the edges of the table
NJS_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
NJS_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
NJS_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
NJS_arctic_a0139 he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
NJS_arctic_a0026 it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
NJS_arctic_b0042 ten minutes had not elapsed since he had dropped the handkerchief
NJS_arctic_b0298 his hand shot out and clutched crooked leg by the neck
NJS_arctic_b0187 her achievements with cocoanuts were a revelation
NJS_arctic_a0041 meanwhile i'll go out to breathe a spell
NJS_arctic_a0099 a maddening joy pounded in his brain
NJS_arctic_a0185 the questions may have come vaguely in his mind
NJS_arctic_a0108 he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
NJS_arctic_a0013 he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
NJS_arctic_a0104 she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
NJS_arctic_a0121 they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
NJS_arctic_a0054 there was nothing on the rock
NJS_arctic_a0303 but they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality
NJS_arctic_a0063 yes it was a man who asked a stranger
NJS_arctic_a0265 the discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment
NJS_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
NJS_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
NJS_arctic_a0556 why he's bought forty pounds of goods from you already
NJS_arctic_a0260 nobody knew his history they of the junta least of all
NJS_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
NJS_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
NJS_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
NJS_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
NJS_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
NJS_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
NJS_arctic_b0269 why not like any railroad station or ferry depot
NJS_arctic_b0413 he may desire to escape pain or to enjoy pleasure
NJS_arctic_b0494 never so strange a prophet came up to jerusalem
NJS_arctic_b0434 the steward has just tendered me a respectful bit of advice
NJS_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
NJS_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
NJS_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i'll go on seeing them forever
NJS_arctic_a0210 its diameter was not more than two hundred yards
NJS_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
NJS_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
NJS_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
NJS_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
NJS_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
NJS_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
NJS_arctic_a0159 they look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life
NJS_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
NJS_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
NJS_arctic_a0269 that's where they cut off the scottish chiefs and killed all hands
NJS_arctic_a0369 in partnership with daylight the pair raided the san jose interurban
NJS_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
NJS_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
NJS_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
NJS_arctic_a0102 he will follow us soon
NJS_arctic_a0198 sometimes her dreams were filled with visions
NJS_arctic_a0271 now please give a plain statement of what occurred
NJS_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
NJS_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quietly as he had come
NJS_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
NJS_arctic_a0154 he was smooth shaven and his hair and eyes were black
NJS_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
NJS_arctic_a0300 from my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror
NJS_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
NJS_arctic_a0212 fresh cases still able to walk they clustered about the spokesman
NJS_arctic_a0363 it's not an attempt to smash the market
NJS_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
NJS_arctic_b0503 the scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land
NJS_arctic_b0304 his previous wives had never lived long enough to bear him children
NJS_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
NJS_arctic_a0233 i never allow what can't be changed to annoy me
NJS_arctic_a0145 i have to be careful of them as they tear very easily
NJS_arctic_a0038 we'll have to watch our chances
NJS_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting
NJS_arctic_a0105 only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
NJS_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
NJS_arctic_a0441 violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me
NJS_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
NJS_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud 
NJS_arctic_a0298 this tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave saxon a little joy thrill
NJS_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
NJS_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
NJS_arctic_a0178 every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated
NJS_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
NJS_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
NJS_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
NJS_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
NJS_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
NJS_arctic_b0538 at the best they were necessary accessories
NJS_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
NJS_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
NJS_arctic_a0254 straight out they swam their heads growing smaller and smaller
NJS_arctic_a0487 the river bared its bosom and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness
NJS_arctic_b0461 by virtue of that power we shall remain in power
NJS_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
NJS_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
NJS_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
NJS_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
NJS_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
NJS_arctic_a0170 there was none of the joy of meeting in his face
NJS_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
NJS_arctic_a0320 with my strength i slammed it full into red eye's face
NJS_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
YKWK_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
YKWK_arctic_a0475 his outstretched arm dropped to his side and he paused
YKWK_arctic_b0386 my idea was that he would have more influence over the natives
YKWK_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
YKWK_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
YKWK_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
YKWK_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
YKWK_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
YKWK_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
YKWK_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
YKWK_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
YKWK_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
YKWK_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
YKWK_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
YKWK_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
YKWK_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened
YKWK_arctic_a0148 now these things had been struck dead within him
YKWK_arctic_a0075 there has been a change she interrupted him
YKWK_arctic_a0090 the singing voice approached rapidly
YKWK_arctic_a0029 their forces were already moving into the north country
YKWK_arctic_a0027 to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
YKWK_arctic_a0018 there was a change now
YKWK_arctic_a0378 that's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged
YKWK_arctic_a0134 he obeyed the pressure of her hand
YKWK_arctic_a0112 he was wounded in the arm
YKWK_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
YKWK_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
YKWK_arctic_b0225 the president of the united states was his friend
YKWK_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
YKWK_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
YKWK_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
YKWK_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
YKWK_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
YKWK_arctic_b0106 for a full minute the two men stared into each other's face
YKWK_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
YKWK_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
YKWK_arctic_b0238 the very thought of the effort to swim over was nauseating
YKWK_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
YKWK_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
YKWK_arctic_b0469 very few people knew of the existence of this law
YKWK_arctic_a0168 low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting
YKWK_arctic_b0530 he had a big chimpanzee that was a winner
YKWK_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
YKWK_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
YKWK_arctic_a0272 you can take a vacation on pay
YKWK_arctic_a0416 the added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour
YKWK_arctic_a0094 he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
YKWK_arctic_b0019 his slim hands gripped the edges of the table
YKWK_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
YKWK_arctic_a0442 you live on an income which your father earned
YKWK_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
YKWK_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
YKWK_arctic_a0139 he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
YKWK_arctic_a0026 it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
YKWK_arctic_a0041 meanwhile i'll go out to breathe a spell
YKWK_arctic_a0099 a maddening joy pounded in his brain
YKWK_arctic_a0108 he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
YKWK_arctic_b0315 and this was their sole conversation throughout the meal
YKWK_arctic_b0215 it is a good property and worth more than that
YKWK_arctic_a0013 he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
YKWK_arctic_a0104 she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
YKWK_arctic_a0121 they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
YKWK_arctic_a0054 there was nothing on the rock
YKWK_arctic_a0303 but they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality
YKWK_arctic_a0063 yes it was a man who asked a stranger
YKWK_arctic_a0143 ah i had forgotten he exclaimed
YKWK_arctic_a0209 it was not a large lake and almost round
YKWK_arctic_b0518 but there was also talk of witchcraft in the village
YKWK_arctic_a0364 we have plenty of capital ourselves and yet we want more
YKWK_arctic_a0542 without a doubt some of them have dinner engagements
YKWK_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
YKWK_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
YKWK_arctic_a0260 nobody knew his history they of the junta least of all
YKWK_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
YKWK_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
YKWK_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
YKWK_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
YKWK_arctic_b0266 and now put yourself in my place for a moment
YKWK_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
YKWK_arctic_b0201 i also understand that similar branch organizations had made their appearance in europe
YKWK_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
YKWK_arctic_b0192 outsiders are allowed five minute speeches the sick man urged
YKWK_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
YKWK_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
YKWK_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i'll go on seeing them forever
YKWK_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
YKWK_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
YKWK_arctic_b0342 each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up
YKWK_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
YKWK_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
YKWK_arctic_b0143 it took him half an hour to reach the edge of it
YKWK_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
YKWK_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
YKWK_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
YKWK_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
YKWK_arctic_a0369 in partnership with daylight the pair raided the san jose interurban
YKWK_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
YKWK_arctic_b0320 the regret in his voice was provocative of a second burst of laughter
YKWK_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
YKWK_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
YKWK_arctic_b0355 there was proper division of labor in the work they individually performed
YKWK_arctic_a0102 he will follow us soon
YKWK_arctic_a0271 now please give a plain statement of what occurred
YKWK_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
YKWK_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quietly as he had come
YKWK_arctic_a0365 these rumors may even originate with us
YKWK_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
YKWK_arctic_a0384 the farmer works the soil and produces grain
YKWK_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
YKWK_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
YKWK_arctic_a0495 he bore no grudges and had few enemies
YKWK_arctic_b0425 there were orange green gold green and a copper green
YKWK_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
YKWK_arctic_b0197 the planters are already considering the matter
YKWK_arctic_b0068 only the chance sound had led him to observe them
YKWK_arctic_b0503 the scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land
YKWK_arctic_b0304 his previous wives had never lived long enough to bear him children
YKWK_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
YKWK_arctic_a0233 i never allow what can't be changed to annoy me
YKWK_arctic_a0145 i have to be careful of them as they tear very easily

YKWK_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
YKWK_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
YKWK_arctic_a0144 but there was something even more startling than this resemblance
YKWK_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud 
YKWK_arctic_b0022 if i was out of the game it would be easily made
YKWK_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
YKWK_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
YKWK_arctic_a0178 every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated
YKWK_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
YKWK_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
YKWK_arctic_a0379 how old are you daddy
YKWK_arctic_b0047 suppose you saw me at work through the window
YKWK_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
YKWK_arctic_a0258 soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays
YKWK_arctic_a0345 she was trying to pass the apron string around him
YKWK_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
YKWK_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
YKWK_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
YKWK_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
YKWK_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
YKWK_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
YKWK_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
YKWK_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
YKWK_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
YKWK_arctic_a0375 the butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants
YKWK_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
YKWK_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
TLV_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
TLV_arctic_b0189 that is what distinguishes all of us from the lower animals
TLV_arctic_a0475 his outstretched arm dropped to his side and he paused
TLV_arctic_b0386 my idea was that he would have more influence over the natives
TLV_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
TLV_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
TLV_arctic_b0288 we would not spend another such night
TLV_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
TLV_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
TLV_arctic_a0515 but here amongst ourselves let us speak out
TLV_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
TLV_arctic_b0465 but such divergence of opinion would constitute no menace to society
TLV_arctic_b0251 they must have been swept away by the chaotic currents
TLV_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
TLV_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
TLV_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
TLV_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
TLV_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
TLV_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
TLV_arctic_b0527 the very idea of it was preposterous
TLV_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
TLV_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened
TLV_arctic_b0481 the task we set ourselves was threefold
TLV_arctic_a0075 there has been a change she interrupted him
TLV_arctic_a0090 the singing voice approached rapidly
TLV_arctic_a0029 their forces were already moving into the north country
TLV_arctic_a0027 to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
TLV_arctic_a0018 there was a change now
TLV_arctic_a0378 that's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged
TLV_arctic_a0134 he obeyed the pressure of her hand
TLV_arctic_a0434 a half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds
TLV_arctic_a0112 he was wounded in the arm
TLV_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
TLV_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
TLV_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
TLV_arctic_b0075 in that case he could not miss them if he used caution
TLV_arctic_b0074 yet behind them there was another and more powerful motive
TLV_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
TLV_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
TLV_arctic_b0323 crickets began to chirp and more geese and ducks flew overhead
TLV_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
TLV_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
TLV_arctic_b0358 the temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip
TLV_arctic_b0140 they edged nearer and stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world
TLV_arctic_b0106 for a full minute the two men stared into each other's face
TLV_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
TLV_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
TLV_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
TLV_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision

TLV_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
TLV_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
TLV_arctic_b0534 i'll tell you the librarian said with a brightening face
TLV_arctic_a0094 he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
TLV_arctic_b0019 his slim hands gripped the edges of the table
TLV_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
TLV_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
TLV_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
TLV_arctic_a0139 he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes

TLV_arctic_a0542 without a doubt some of them have dinner engagements
TLV_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
TLV_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
TLV_arctic_a0260 nobody knew his history they of the junta least of all
TLV_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
TLV_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
TLV_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
TLV_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
TLV_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
TLV_arctic_b0201 i also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in europe
TLV_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
TLV_arctic_b0416 i arose obediently and went down the beach
TLV_arctic_b0192 outsiders are allowed five minute speeches the sick man urged
TLV_arctic_b0380 he had peeled off his shirt and was wildly waving it
TLV_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
TLV_arctic_a0519 such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land
TLV_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
TLV_arctic_b0509 he had fulfilled his duty and paid properly
TLV_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i will go on seeing them forever
TLV_arctic_b0415 there was nothing for us but the wide raw ocean
TLV_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
TLV_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
TLV_arctic_b0342 each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up
TLV_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
TLV_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
TLV_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
TLV_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
TLV_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
TLV_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
TLV_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
TLV_arctic_a0225 i was brought up the way most girls in hawaii are brought up
TLV_arctic_b0320 the regret in his voice was provocative of a second burst of laughter
TLV_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
TLV_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
TLV_arctic_b0355 there was proper division of labor in the work they individually performed
TLV_arctic_a0459 there's too much of the schoolboy in me
TLV_arctic_a0102 he will follow us soon
TLV_arctic_a0271 now please give a plain statement of what occurred
TLV_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
TLV_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quietly as he had come
TLV_arctic_b0488 beyond refusing to sell us food they left us to ourselves
TLV_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
TLV_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
TLV_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
TLV_arctic_b0425 there were orange green gold green and a copper green
TLV_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
TLV_arctic_b0048 he looked like one who had passed through an uncomfortable hour or two
TLV_arctic_b0503 the scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land
TLV_arctic_b0165 he pulled and the log crashed down to break his back
TLV_arctic_b0304 his previous wives had never lived long enough to bear him children
TLV_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
TLV_arctic_b0393 i was still weak from my prolonged immersion
TLV_arctic_a0038 we'll have to watch our chances
TLV_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting
TLV_arctic_a0105 only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
TLV_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
TLV_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
TLV_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud 
TLV_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
TLV_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
TLV_arctic_a0178 every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated
TLV_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
TLV_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
TLV_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
TLV_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
TLV_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
TLV_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
TLV_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
TLV_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
TLV_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
TLV_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
TLV_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
TLV_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
TLV_arctic_a0375 the butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants
TLV_arctic_b0422 this was when the explosion occurred
TLV_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
TLV_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
TXHC_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
TXHC_arctic_b0189 that is what distinguishes all of us from the lower animals
TXHC_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
TXHC_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
TXHC_arctic_b0288 we would not spend another such night
TXHC_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
TXHC_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
TXHC_arctic_a0515 but here amongst ourselves let us speak out
TXHC_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
TXHC_arctic_b0531 i am sure it must have been some adventure
TXHC_arctic_b0465 but such divergence of opinion would constitute no menace to society
TXHC_arctic_b0479 violation of this law was made a high misdemeanor and punished accordingly
TXHC_arctic_b0251 they must have been swept away by the chaotic currents
TXHC_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
TXHC_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
TXHC_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
TXHC_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
TXHC_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
TXHC_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
TXHC_arctic_b0527 the very idea of it was preposterous
TXHC_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
TXHC_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened
TXHC_arctic_a0549 do you know that we weigh every pound of coal we burn
TXHC_arctic_b0481 the task we set ourselves was threefold
TXHC_arctic_a0075 there has been a change she interrupted him
TXHC_arctic_a0090 the singing voice approached rapidly
TXHC_arctic_a0029 their forces were already moving into the north country
TXHC_arctic_a0027 to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
TXHC_arctic_a0018 there was a change now
TXHC_arctic_a0536 he would destroy all things that are fixed
TXHC_arctic_a0134 he obeyed the pressure of her hand
TXHC_arctic_b0026 you have associated with some of these men
TXHC_arctic_a0434 a half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds
TXHC_arctic_a0112 he was wounded in the arm
TXHC_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
TXHC_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
TXHC_arctic_a0576 and the big persian knew of his existence before he did of hers
TXHC_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
TXHC_arctic_b0075 in that case he could not miss them if he used caution
TXHC_arctic_b0074 yet behind them there was another and more powerful motive
TXHC_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
TXHC_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
TXHC_arctic_b0323 crickets began to chirp and more geese and ducks flew overhead
TXHC_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
TXHC_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
TXHC_arctic_b0358 the temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip
TXHC_arctic_b0140 they edged nearer and stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world
TXHC_arctic_b0385 last night he showed all the symptoms of coming down with pneumonia
TXHC_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
TXHC_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
TXHC_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
TXHC_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
TXHC_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
TXHC_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
TXHC_arctic_b0004 when i can't see beauty in woman i want to die
TXHC_arctic_b0282 some of the smaller veins had doubtless been ruptured
TXHC_arctic_a0094 he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
TXHC_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
TXHC_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
TXHC_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
TXHC_arctic_a0139 he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
TXHC_arctic_a0026 it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
TXHC_arctic_a0041 meanwhile i'll go out to breathe a spell
TXHC_arctic_a0099 a maddening joy pounded in his brain
TXHC_arctic_a0108 he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
TXHC_arctic_a0013 he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
TXHC_arctic_a0571 he had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out
TXHC_arctic_b0483 the flower of the artistic and intellectual world were revolutionists
TXHC_arctic_a0104 she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
TXHC_arctic_a0121 they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
TXHC_arctic_a0054 there was nothing on the rock
TXHC_arctic_a0063 yes it was a man who asked a stranger
TXHC_arctic_a0245 out of his eighteen hundred he laid aside sixteen hundred each year
TXHC_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
TXHC_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
TXHC_arctic_a0335 red eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down
TXHC_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
TXHC_arctic_b0418 at that moment i got the impression that she was willowy
TXHC_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
TXHC_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
TXHC_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
TXHC_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
TXHC_arctic_b0142 something vastly more thrilling had come into it now
TXHC_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
TXHC_arctic_b0416 i arose obediently and went down the beach
TXHC_arctic_a0575 there weren't any missions and he was the man to know
TXHC_arctic_b0380 he had peeled off his shirt and was wildly waving it
TXHC_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
TXHC_arctic_a0519 such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land
TXHC_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
TXHC_arctic_b0509 he had fulfilled his duty and paid properly
TXHC_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i'll go on seeing them forever
TXHC_arctic_b0185 your being wrecked here has been a godsend to me
TXHC_arctic_b0415 there was nothing for us but the wide raw ocean
TXHC_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
TXHC_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
TXHC_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
TXHC_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
TXHC_arctic_b0430 they were babbling and chattering all together
TXHC_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
TXHC_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
TXHC_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
TXHC_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
TXHC_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
TXHC_arctic_a0225 i was brought up the way most girls in hawaii are brought up
TXHC_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
TXHC_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
TXHC_arctic_a0459 there's too much of the schoolboy in me
TXHC_arctic_a0102 he will follow us soon
TXHC_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
TXHC_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quietly as he had come
TXHC_arctic_b0488 beyond refusing to sell us food they left us to ourselves
TXHC_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
TXHC_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
TXHC_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
TXHC_arctic_b0476 the reorganization of these countries took the form of revolution
TXHC_arctic_b0456 he was an amphibian and a mountaineer
TXHC_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
TXHC_arctic_b0048 he looked like one who had passed through an uncomfortable hour or two
TXHC_arctic_b0165 he pulled and the log crashed down to break his back
TXHC_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
TXHC_arctic_b0393 i was still weak from my prolonged immersion
TXHC_arctic_a0038 we'll have to watch our chances
TXHC_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting
TXHC_arctic_a0105 only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
TXHC_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
TXHC_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
TXHC_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud 
TXHC_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
TXHC_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
TXHC_arctic_b0400 how could i answer the question on the spur of the moment
TXHC_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
TXHC_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
TXHC_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
TXHC_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
TXHC_arctic_b0366 i forgot how easily i had taught myself from the printed page
TXHC_arctic_b0402 an altruistic act is an act performed for the welfare of others
TXHC_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
TXHC_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
TXHC_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
TXHC_arctic_b0461 by virtue of that power we shall remain in power
TXHC_arctic_b0203 a month in australia would finish me
TXHC_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
TXHC_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
TXHC_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
TXHC_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
TXHC_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
TXHC_arctic_b0422 this was when the explosion occurred
TXHC_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
TXHC_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
ZHAA_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
ZHAA_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
ZHAA_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
ZHAA_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
ZHAA_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
ZHAA_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
ZHAA_arctic_b0150 and he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear
ZHAA_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
ZHAA_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
ZHAA_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
ZHAA_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
ZHAA_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
ZHAA_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself

ZHAA_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
ZHAA_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
ZHAA_arctic_b0455 his reward should have been peace and repose
ZHAA_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
ZHAA_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
ZHAA_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
ZHAA_arctic_b0444 he did not know what went on in the minds of his superiors
ZHAA_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
ZHAA_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
ZHAA_arctic_b0106 for a full minute the two men stared into each other's face
ZHAA_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
ZHAA_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
ZHAA_arctic_b0103 he lifted his eyes and a strange cry burst from his lips
ZHAA_arctic_b0340 these quick little joys of hers were sources of joy to him
ZHAA_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
ZHAA_arctic_a0500 who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury
ZHAA_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
ZHAA_arctic_b0469 very few people knew of the existence of this law
ZHAA_arctic_a0529 as i say he had tapped the message very rapidly
ZHAA_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
ZHAA_arctic_b0016 he chuckled as he pulled out his pipe and began filling it
ZHAA_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
ZHAA_arctic_b0534 i'll tell you the librarian said with a brightening face
ZHAA_arctic_b0490 what an excited whispering and conferring took place
ZHAA_arctic_a0094 he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
ZHAA_arctic_a0548 also churches and preachers i had never known
ZHAA_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
ZHAA_arctic_a0461 ah we were very close together in that moment
ZHAA_arctic_b0433 we are cooking on the coal stove and on the oil burners
ZHAA_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
ZHAA_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
ZHAA_arctic_a0139 he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
ZHAA_arctic_a0026 it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
ZHAA_arctic_a0041 meanwhile i'll go out to breathe a spell
ZHAA_arctic_a0099 a maddening joy pounded in his brain
ZHAA_arctic_b0307 we got few vegetables and fruits and became fish eaters
ZHAA_arctic_a0108 he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
ZHAA_arctic_a0013 he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
ZHAA_arctic_a0104 she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
ZHAA_arctic_a0121 they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
ZHAA_arctic_a0054 there was nothing on the rock
ZHAA_arctic_a0063 yes it was a man who asked a stranger
ZHAA_arctic_a0214 besides he was paid one case of tobacco per head
ZHAA_arctic_b0518 but there was also talk of witchcraft in the village
ZHAA_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
ZHAA_arctic_a0501 you're joking me sir the other managed to articulate
ZHAA_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
ZHAA_arctic_b0158 she obeyed shrinking back with the baby in her arms
ZHAA_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
ZHAA_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
ZHAA_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
ZHAA_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
ZHAA_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
ZHAA_arctic_b0504 the life there was healthful and athletic but too juvenile
ZHAA_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
ZHAA_arctic_b0367 any average young fellow can teach himself in a week
ZHAA_arctic_b0413 he may desire to escape pain or to enjoy pleasure
ZHAA_arctic_b0494 never so strange a prophet came up to jerusalem
ZHAA_arctic_b0495 we who have endured so much surely can endure a little more
ZHAA_arctic_b0434 the steward has just tendered me a respectful bit of advice
ZHAA_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
ZHAA_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
ZHAA_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i'll go on seeing them forever
ZHAA_arctic_b0438 they ran the canoe in and climbed the high earth bank
ZHAA_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
ZHAA_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
ZHAA_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
ZHAA_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
ZHAA_arctic_a0257 they are coming ashore whoever they are
ZHAA_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
ZHAA_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
ZHAA_arctic_a0159 they look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life
ZHAA_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
ZHAA_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
ZHAA_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
ZHAA_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
ZHAA_arctic_b0146 after all it was simply a mistake in judgment
ZHAA_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
ZHAA_arctic_a0102 he will follow us soon
ZHAA_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
ZHAA_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quietly as he had come
ZHAA_arctic_b0452 they saw each other for the first time in boston
ZHAA_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
ZHAA_arctic_b0324 not till the twentieth of may did the river break
ZHAA_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
ZHAA_arctic_a0300 from my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror
ZHAA_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
ZHAA_arctic_b0425 there were orange green gold green and a copper green
ZHAA_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
ZHAA_arctic_b0126 blood was oozing slowly from the wounded man's right breast
ZHAA_arctic_b0424 it is a very tenable hypothesis and will bear looking into
ZHAA_arctic_b0068 only the chance sound had led him to observe them
ZHAA_arctic_b0503 the scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land
ZHAA_arctic_b0432 he is a candidate rising from the serf class to our class
ZHAA_arctic_b0492 thus he turned the tenets and jargon of psychology back on me
ZHAA_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
ZHAA_arctic_a0038 we'll have to watch our chances
ZHAA_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting
ZHAA_arctic_a0105 only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
ZHAA_arctic_b0348 would you be satisfied with that one hundredth part of me
ZHAA_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
ZHAA_arctic_a0426 they do not know the length of time of incubation
ZHAA_arctic_a0441 violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me
ZHAA_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
ZHAA_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud 
ZHAA_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
ZHAA_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
ZHAA_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
ZHAA_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
ZHAA_arctic_a0379 how old are you daddy
ZHAA_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
ZHAA_arctic_b0428 the history of our westward faring race is written in it
ZHAA_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
ZHAA_arctic_b0310 a little treatment massage with some help from the doctor
ZHAA_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
ZHAA_arctic_b0538 at the best they were necessary accessories
ZHAA_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
ZHAA_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
ZHAA_arctic_b0461 by virtue of that power we shall remain in power
ZHAA_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
ZHAA_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
ZHAA_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
ZHAA_arctic_b0083 in it there was something that was almost tragedy
ZHAA_arctic_b0506 it would help to tide me along until i got steady employment
ZHAA_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
ZHAA_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
ZHAA_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
ZHAA_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
TNI_arctic_a0091 his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
TNI_arctic_a0020 clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
TNI_arctic_a0005 will we ever forget it
TNI_arctic_a0199 thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day
TNI_arctic_a0039 the ship should be in within a week or ten days
TNI_arctic_a0113 i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
TNI_arctic_a0008 gad your letter came just in time
TNI_arctic_b0171 he changed his seat for a steamer reclining chair
TNI_arctic_b0396 the pain from my hurt knee was agonizing
TNI_arctic_a0123 she had died from cold and starvation
TNI_arctic_a0022 hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
TNI_arctic_a0100 you must sleep he urged
TNI_arctic_a0101 you you would not keep the truth from me
TNI_arctic_a0007 and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
TNI_arctic_a0125 he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
TNI_arctic_a0109 do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
TNI_arctic_a0093 for a full minute he crouched and listened
TNI_arctic_a0188 two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass
TNI_arctic_b0002 you got out by fighting and i through a pretty girl
TNI_arctic_b0317 he did not believe in the burning of daylight for such a luxury
TNI_arctic_a0075 there has been a change she interrupted him
TNI_arctic_a0090 the singing voice approached rapidly
TNI_arctic_a0029 their forces were already moving into the north country
TNI_arctic_a0027 to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
TNI_arctic_a0018 there was a change now
TNI_arctic_a0134 he obeyed the pressure of her hand
TNI_arctic_a0191 for a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone
TNI_arctic_a0112 he was wounded in the arm
TNI_arctic_a0098 shall i carry you
TNI_arctic_a0107 if you only could know how i thank you
TNI_arctic_a0301 but all my dreams violated this law
TNI_arctic_a0115 he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
TNI_arctic_a0003 for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
TNI_arctic_b0061 something about it seemed to fascinate him to challenge his presence
TNI_arctic_a0046 the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
TNI_arctic_a0136 about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
TNI_arctic_a0073 the promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
TNI_arctic_b0081 you were going to leave after you saw me on the rock
TNI_arctic_b0017 everything was working smoothly better than i had expected
TNI_arctic_a0246 you have heard always how he was the lover of princess naomi
TNI_arctic_a0086 death had come with terrible suddenness
TNI_arctic_a0137 then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
TNI_arctic_b0118 we saw your light and thought you wouldn't mind a call
TNI_arctic_a0030 i had faith in them
TNI_arctic_a0095 a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
TNI_arctic_a0168 a low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting
TNI_arctic_b0104 shooting pains passed like flashes of electricity through his body
TNI_arctic_a0424 obviously it was a disease that could be contracted by contact
TNI_arctic_a0130 she was his now forever
TNI_arctic_b0089 her beautiful hair was done up in shining coils
TNI_arctic_a0071 what was the object of your little sensation
TNI_arctic_a0272 you can take a vacation on pay
TNI_arctic_a0416 the added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour
TNI_arctic_a0094 he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
TNI_arctic_a0025 i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
TNI_arctic_b0433 we are cooking on the coal stove and on the oil burners
TNI_arctic_b0136 swiftly his eyes measured the situation
TNI_arctic_a0031 they were three hundred yards apart
TNI_arctic_a0064 the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
TNI_arctic_a0139 he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
TNI_arctic_a0026 it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
TNI_arctic_a0041 meanwhile i will go out to breathe a spell
TNI_arctic_a0099 a maddening joy pounded in his brain
TNI_arctic_a0108 he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
TNI_arctic_b0315 and this was their sole conversation throughout the meal
TNI_arctic_b0215 it is a good property and worth more than that
TNI_arctic_a0013 he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
TNI_arctic_a0104 she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
TNI_arctic_a0121 they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
TNI_arctic_a0411 it will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand
TNI_arctic_a0054 there was nothing on the rock
TNI_arctic_a0303 but they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality
TNI_arctic_a0063 yes it was a man who asked a stranger
TNI_arctic_a0214 besides he was paid one case of tobacco per head
TNI_arctic_b0141 it was beating and waiting in the ambush of those black pits
TNI_arctic_b0038 in her haste to get away she had forgotten these things
TNI_arctic_a0062 the men stared into each other's face
TNI_arctic_a0111 instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
TNI_arctic_b0158 she obeyed shrinking back with the baby in her arms
TNI_arctic_a0021 it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
TNI_arctic_a0040 i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
TNI_arctic_a0076 the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
TNI_arctic_a0097 then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
TNI_arctic_a0065 they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
TNI_arctic_a0096 perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
TNI_arctic_a0255 you won't die of malnutrition be sure of that
TNI_arctic_a0060 anyway no one saw her like that
TNI_arctic_a0085 a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
TNI_arctic_a0006 god bless 'em i hope i'll go on seeing them forever
TNI_arctic_a0410 so we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well
TNI_arctic_a0058 i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
TNI_arctic_a0106 the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
TNI_arctic_a0048 he looked at the handkerchief more closely
TNI_arctic_a0131 providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
TNI_arctic_a0127 it was a temptation but he resisted it
TNI_arctic_a0047 close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog
TNI_arctic_a0159 they look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life
TNI_arctic_a0023 a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
TNI_arctic_a0122 two years ago i gave up civilization for this
TNI_arctic_a0269 that's where they cut off the scottish chiefs and killed all hands
TNI_arctic_b0160 it was over when he made his way through the ring of spectators
TNI_arctic_a0092 he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
TNI_arctic_a0088 he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
TNI_arctic_b0073 with these arguments he convinced himself that he should go on alone
TNI_arctic_a0024 it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
TNI_arctic_a0102 he will follow us soon
TNI_arctic_a0282 if you mean to insinuate brentwood began hotly
TNI_arctic_a0051 the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
TNI_arctic_a0045 he moved away as quietly as he had come
TNI_arctic_a0292 here in the midmorning the first casualty occurred
TNI_arctic_a0365 these rumors may even originate with us
TNI_arctic_a0059 his immaculate appearance was gone
TNI_arctic_a0384 the farmer works the soil and produces grain
TNI_arctic_a0126 each day she became a more vital part of him
TNI_arctic_a0128 this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
TNI_arctic_a0116 was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
TNI_arctic_b0197 the planters are already considering the matter
TNI_arctic_a0266 they handled two men already both grub thieves
TNI_arctic_a0067 surely i will excuse you she cried
TNI_arctic_a0038 we'll have to watch our chances
TNI_arctic_a0037 i was the only one who remained sitting
TNI_arctic_a0105 only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
TNI_arctic_a0053 suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
TNI_arctic_a0077 it is the fire partly she said
TNI_arctic_a0208 youth had come back to her freed from the yoke of oppression
TNI_arctic_a0144 but there was something even more startling than this resemblance
TNI_arctic_a0028 robbery bribery fraud
TNI_arctic_a0078 then and at supper he tried to fathom her
TNI_arctic_a0052 it was a curious coincidence
TNI_arctic_a0178 every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated
TNI_arctic_a0089 the night glow was treacherous to shoot by
TNI_arctic_a0032 since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
TNI_arctic_b0047 suppose you saw me at work through the window
TNI_arctic_a0011 if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
TNI_arctic_b0057 they have won popular sentiment through the newspapers
TNI_arctic_a0405 it seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work
TNI_arctic_a0117 she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
TNI_arctic_b0371 yield yourself to the waters that are ripping and tearing at you
TNI_arctic_a0019 i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
TNI_arctic_a0036 she turned in at the hotel
TNI_arctic_a0129 her face was against his breast
TNI_arctic_a0010 i'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
TNI_arctic_a0082 his face was streaming with blood
TNI_arctic_a0103 but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
TNI_arctic_b0411 he gave no reason but his motive was obvious enough
TNI_arctic_a0042 how could he explain his possession of the sketch
TNI_arctic_a0079 it was a large canoe
TNI_arctic_a0120 my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
TNI_arctic_a0081 what if she did not come to the rock
TNI_arctic_b0321 instead he arrived on the night of the second day
